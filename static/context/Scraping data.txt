=======================

- What is Al-Haram (The Sanctuary) and Why Is It so Important?

It is the place where it is forbidden to do certain things that are not forbidden elsewhere.
Avoiding such things in this place testifies to
one’s veneration of Allah who has declared
such things forbidden in it:
“All this is ordained by Allah; therefore, venerate His commandments. Those who venerate Allah’s commandments and honour
His sacred rites will fare better in the sight
of their Lord.” (22:30)

Allah has chosen and exalted this land and
made it a sanctuary, in which He has forbidden what He has made permissible in other
places and conferred on it manifold virtues
and benefits that are not found elsewhere.

Its sanctity and lofty status are deeply rooted
in the history of the entire universe.
Indeed, Allah chose this land and made it
sacred on the day He created this universe
and it will continue to be as such until the
end of time.
The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, “Allah made this town a sanctuary on the day
He created the heavens and the earth, and
it will remain a sanctuary—as Allah has
ordained—until the Day of Resurrection.”

- What Does Al-Haram Mean to Me?

You are now in a place on which Allah
conferred a lofty status, honour and virtue before He created humans, and commanded Abraham, peace be upon him, to
raise the foundations of the Ka’bah and
build its walls upon them to be the prayer
direction (qiblah) and provide guidance to
all mankind:
“The first house of worship ever set up
for mankind was indeed the one in Bakkah—a blessed place and source of guidance for all mankind.” (3:96)

You are in a place where the reward for
one good deed is multiplied many times
over, and the sin incurred for one bad
deed is not like that committed anywhere
else. 

Allah commanded his noblest servants,
Abraham and Ishmael, peace be upon
them, and after them His Messenger, Muhammad, peace be upon him, to purify it,
maintain it and take good care of it.

- Al-Haram Boundaries

The Sanctuary (Al-Haram) has wellknown boundaries which Allah taught
Abraham, peace be upon him. Knowledge
of these boundaries had been passed
down from one generation to another
and was ultimately approved and clarified by the Messenger of Allah, peace
be upon him.
They can be seen today on the roads
leading to Makkah.

Their distances from the Ka’bah differ from one place to another:
From Taif (Al Hada) Road:
15.5 km
From Al-Madinah Al-Nabawiyah
(At-Tan’eem) Road:
6.5 km
From Jeddah Expressway:
22 km
From the new Al-Laith Road:
17 km
From At-Taif (As-Sail) Road:
12.850 km

Al-Haram area holds a very special position in Islam because there are rulings
related to it for those who enter it. We
are going to learn about some of these
rulings in this guide.

- What Are the Distinguishing Characteristics of Al-Haram?

There are a number of rules and virtues
that pertain solely to Makkah and its
sanctuary (Al-Haram), to the exclusion
of all other places on earth, including
the following:

1- The reward for one single prayer in
Makkah sanctuary (Al-Haram)—including all mosques and houses in Makkah
that are within it—is equivalent to one
hundred thousand prayers anywhere
else.

2- Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter it.

3- It is forbidden to engage in any form of hunting animals and birds in it.

4- It is forbidden to cut down its trees or
grass

5- Any person who enters it is safe with
regard to his life and property and thus
must not be killed or wronged in any
way. The Almighty says, “Whoever enters it is safe.” (3:97)

During the pilgrimage season, entry
to Makkah is efficiently organized and
anyone without a hajj permit is not allowed to enter it so that pilgrims may be
served in the best possible manner.

- The Ka’bah

The Ka’bah is the direction which
Muslims face in their prayers (qiblah)
and to which their hearts incline. It is
only around it that they walk (perform
tawaf) as an act of worship to Allah Almighty.

The Ka’bah has four corners that are
named after the directions they are facing:
¨ The Yemeni Corner in the south
¨ The Black Stone in the east
¨ The Syrian Corner in the west
¨ The Iraqi Corner in the north

Al-Hateem (Hijr Ismaa’eel)
This is a semi-circular open space next
to the Ka’bah, part of which used to be
part of the Ka’bah.

The Door of the Ka’bah
¨ It is located on the eastern side of it.
¨ Its length is 318 cm and its width is 171
cm.
¨ It is made today of pure gold and weighs
280 kilograms.

Al-Multazam
This is the eastern wall or part of it
between the Black Stone and the door
of the Ka’bah.
Iltizaam refers to the act of placing one’s
chest, face, arms and palms on this
wall and supplicating Allah Almighty for
whatever one wishes. Doing so may be
difficult or rather impossible during the
hajj season and in overcrowded conditions

Al-Meezaab (The Roof Drain)
This is the part that is attached to the
roof of the Ka’bah to channel water from
the roof, which then falls onto Hijr Ismaa’eel.

Ash-Shaadharwaan (The Riser)
This is a structure that supports the
Ka’bah and surrounds it from three sides.
It was initially erected to strengthen
the Ka’bah and protect it from torrential rain. It has been preserved over the
years and is covered today with white
marble.


- The Black Stone

¨ The Black Stone is one of the stones of
Paradise, as the Prophet, peace be upon
him, once mentioned.
¨ It is the start and finish points of each circumambulation (tawaaf) that pilgrims
perform around the Ka’bah.
¨ The Prophet, peace be upon him, deposited it in its proper place following a dispute that broke out between people as
to who should have the honour of raising
it to its place after part of the building of
the Ka’bah was damaged by heavy rain.

The Location of the Black Stone
¨ It is located in the southeastern corner of the Ka’bah.
¨ It rises 1.5 m from the ground.

The Silver Frame:
¨ The Black Stone is encased in a silver
frame that serves to protect it.
¨ The first to join the parts of Black
Stone with silver was ‘Abdullaah ibn
Az-Zubayr, may Allah be pleased with
him.

Touching and Kissing the Black Stone
¨ A pilgrim should touch and kiss the Black
Stone at each circuit, as this was the very
practice of the Prophet, peace be upon
him, as far as it is possible in the off-seasons when there is no overcrowding.
¨ A pilgrim should recite the takbeer (say,
‘Allaahu akbar’) when touching it or waving at it from afar in case of overcrowding

A Muslim must avoid jostling and
joining crowds to kiss the Black Stone,
as this may cause harm to himself and
to others.

- Maqaam Ibraaheem (Abraham’s Station)

Maqaam Ibraaheem is the stone on which
Abraham, peace be upon him, stood when
he was building the Ka’bah.
It is one of the clear signs in Al-Haram, as
the Almighty says, “In it are clear signs [testifying to its exalted status], including the
place where Abraham stood” (3:97).

Its Location:
 In front of the door of the Ka’bah
10-11 m east of the Ka’bah

Its Shape:
 It is square-shaped with two oval pits
in the middle bearing the footprints of
Prophet Ibraham (Ibraaheem), peace be
upon him.

Its Colour:
 The shades of black, yellow and white.

Its Size:
 Its width, length and height are 50 cm.

¨ The stone is housed today in a glass
enclosure.
¨ It is also silver-coated from all sides.

Anyone who has performed tawaf
around the Ka’bah is recommended, as
far as he can, to perform a two-rak’ah
prayer between Maqam Ibraaheem and
the Ka’bah in a place that is suitable for
prayer even if it is far away. As the Almighty says, “Make the place where Abraham stood a place of worship.” (2:125)

However, strictly follow the instructions of
security officers and try not to harm or harass
others when performing this prayer. You can
pray anywhere behind Maqaam Ibraaheem,
far away from crowds, or anywhere in the
Grand Mosque.


- Safa and Marwa 

These are two small mountains which
Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, peace be
upon him, climbed in her search of food
or water.

Safa:
¨ This is a small mountain from which
walking back and forth between these
two mountains (Sa’ee) begins.
¨ The mountain rocks are still visible on
the ground floor of the Mas’aa (the
path extending between Safa and
Marwa)

Marwa: 

This is a small mountain at which walking back and forth between these two
mountains (Sa’ee) ends.

Walking back and forth between Safa
and Marwa (Sa’ee) them is one of the
rites of the major and minor pilgrimage (hajj and ‘umrah).
The Almighty says, “Safa and Marwa
are among the apparent symbols of
Allah’s religion [that have been prescribed for the performance of the pilgrimage].” (2:158) 



- The Well of Zamzam

¨ It is located east of the Ka’bah, 21
meters away from it.
¨ The circumference of the well is
3.60 m

Other Names of Zamzam:

¨ Suqyaa Ismaa’eel (Allah’s Gift of
Water to Ishmael), Saafiyah (Pure),
Mubaarakah (Blessed) Saalimah
(Flawless) and Taahirah (Pure)


Caliphs and kings throughout the
ages have taken great care of the well
of Zamzam.

This interest has continued to the
Saudi era.

This began with the reign of King Abdul-Azeez, may Allah have mercy on
him:
¨ In 1345 AH (1926 CE), he gave orders
to install drinking fountains to provide Zamzam water for free (Sabeel).
¨ In the following year, he ordered the
construction of the second Sabeel
drinking fountains, as well the restoration of the well and the placement
of a cover over it.

And has continued until the reign of
King Salman, may Allah protect him:
¨ In 1439 AH (2018 CE), he gave orders to complete the Zamzam Well
restoration project.
¨ He also ordered the construction
of five-service bridges to Zamzam
well from the eastern side.

Zamzam Watering Department
It monitors the operations connected
with the Well of Zamzam so that water is
offered to pilgrims performing hajj and
umrah according to the highest quality
standards.

Zamzam Laboratory
¨ This service supervises the stages of
sterilization of Zamzam water.
¨ It monitors the process of filling water tankers that transport Zamzam
water to the Prophet’s Mosque.

- Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah

Al Madinah Al-Munawwarah was the abode
where the Prophet Muhammad m migrated to and resided, and the place where his
grave and his honorable body are.
It is the second holiest city for Muslims after Makkah.
It was also the first capital of Islam, and the
nucleus of Islamic civilization whose light
spread throughout the world.

In this guide, you will find the most important information and directions for a
complete visit to the Mosque of the Messenger of Allah 







- Madinah’s virtue and position

The Prophet’s city is the second holiest spot
in Islam, and Allah has singled it out with
many virtues, including:

It is the home of Islam and guidance:

The Prophet’s city was and will remain
the home of Islam and guidance; from it it
goes out and to it it will return. And from
it, it will grow and multiply, as the Prophet m said:
Verily, belief returns and goes back to Madinah as a snake returns and goes back
to its hole (when in danger).”





That it is blessed:

Blessing means the abundance and growth
of goodness, and the Messenger of Allah
 supplicated for Madinah to be blessed in its food, sustenance, and all its affairs, when he said:
“O Allah, bless us in our fruits; bless us
in our city; bless us in our saa‘ and bless
us in our mudd. O Allah, Ibraahim (Abraham) was Thy servant, friend and prophet, and I am Thy servant and prophet. He
made supplication to Thee on behalf of
Makkah, and I make on behalf of Madinah the same supplication as he made on
behalf of Makkah, and as much again.” 





That it is a sanctuary:

A sanctuary in which (the reward for)
good deeds are multiplied, and bad
deeds are magnified. Harming its people is considered one of the greatest
sins in the sight of Allah.











- The different names for Madinah:

The city of the Prophet has several
names which carry great meanings


From these names are the following:
Al-Madinah (the city):
 Every city is ascribed to what follows it (like: the
city of London, the city of Amsterdam, etc), except for the city of Allah’s Messenger, as it is THE city defined by itself.

It is then described as An-Nabawiyyah
(prophetic):, referring to the Prophet
Muhammad m.
It is described as Munawwarah (enlightened): because of the light of the
Chosen One , who illuminated it with
guidance and the religion of Islam after the migration.




Daar-ul-Hijrah (the abode of Hijrah):
because it was the land which had
the honour to welcome the Messenger of Allah and his companions and
had the honour to come to their aid
and defend them.
Taybah: which is derived from
“At-Tayyib”, meaning something
which is good, nice, beautiful, pure,
and graceful. This is because of the
purity of its soil, the goodness of its
inhabitants, and the good quality of
life in it. 









- Al-Masjid An-Nabawi; the Prophet’s Mosque
The second greatest mosque in Islam
after the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah) is Al-Masjid An-Nabawi. It was
built by the Messenger of Allah m
and his companions after their migration to Madinah. It was a center
of knowledge and civilization, where
the Qur’an was recited and the companions gathered with our Noble
Messenger, benefiting from his
blessing and guidance






- A multiplication of reward for the prayers
The reward for a prayer performed in
the Prophet’s Mosque is multiplied,
as the Prophet m said: “And a prayer
performed in this mosque of mine is
equal to a thousand prayers in any
other mosque, except for the Sacred
Mosque (in Makkah).”








- Travelling to visit the mosque
It is desirable for a Muslim, if he is
able, to travel to pray in the mosque
of the Messenger of Allah, as he m
said: “Mounts are saddled only for
prayer in the three mosques: the sacred mosque, this mosque of mine,
and the Al-Aqsa mosque.”

The Muslims have successively built and
taken care of it, following their Noble
Messenger.
It was expanded more than once by the
Kings of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
After the expansions carried out by the
Saudi state in the mosque on all different
floors, its prayer area is now bigger than
500,000 square metres (5,382,000 sq.ft.)




The Old Mosque: This is the mosque in
which the Messenger of Allah m and his
companions prayed. Its historical shape
and ancient inscriptions have been preserved.


As-Sarhaat (the Courtyards): Two roofless areas behind the old mosque. In the
past, they were furnished with pebbles,
and for this reason the Sarhah is called:
Al-Haswah (the place covered with pebbles). Nowadays, there are sunshades
which open automatically during the day
to protect the worshipers from the sun,
and they close at night to ventilate the
mosque.



The expansions: These are the other
buildings of the mosque, surrounding the
Sarhaat


The open squares: The open squaresare
large areas prepared for worshipers, covered
with sunshades which open and close automatically to protect the worshipers from the
sun, and also contain ventilation and mist
sprayers to cool the air for the worshipers.

Area
235,000m2

Accommodation
450,000
worshippers








- Some facts and figures about the Masjid An-Nabawi
229 Indoor and outdoor gates
196 Fixed and moving domes
10 Minarets
10496 Quran holders
262 Sunshades in the open square and inside the mosque
424 Mist Fans















- Al-Hujrah Ash-Shareefah (the Honourable Room)
The name (the Honorable Room) is
given to the house of the Prophetm in
which he was staying with the mother
of the believers, ‘Aishah bint Abi Bakr
Al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with
her and her father. Allah Almighty honored ‘Aishah by placing in her room
the tomb of the Prophet m and his
two companions, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq
and Umar ibn al-Khattab, may Allah be
pleased with them both.

This honourable room is located to
the southeast of the Noble Prophet’s
Mosque, and its door opens directly to
the honourable Rawdah.
For this reason, the Prophet m may
have offered his head to ‘Aishah, may
Allah be pleased with her, so that she
could do his hair and comb it while he
m was in seclusion in the mosque.

When the Messenger of Allah m fell
ill, he passed away in ‘Aishah’s room,
after he had asked permission from
the mothers of the believers to be
nursed in ‘Aishah’s room, may Allah
be pleased with her, and they gave
him permission.


After the Prophet m died, he was buried
where he died, because he said: “Every
prophet is buried where he dies.” So he
m was buried in this room .
Then his two companions, Abu Bakr
As-Siddiq and Umar bin Al-Khattab,
were buried there after him.


The room remained outside the
mosque but then became a part of
it after the subsequent expansions
which took place in the mosque.
The Muslims took great care to protect the honourable room from rain,
floods, and the enemies of Islam,
with a building and walls which preserve the honourable room for its
occupant m and which preserve the
commandment of the Messenger of
Allah that his grave should not be
taken as a place of celebration or a
place for polytheism and worship of
other than Allah.


Above the room today, we find a
distinctive green dome marking
the room. It was painted green in
1253 AH.










- Giving greetings (salaam) to the Prophet 

It is recommended (mustahabb) for
anyone who is in Madinah to visit the
grave of the Prophet and greet him.

















- Description of visiting the grave of the Prophet 

1- One enters through the Salaam Gate at
the front of the Prophet’s Mosque, to
the east, and walks with serenity and
dignity.
2- When one reaches the opposite of the
Prophet’s room, the place of his honorable grave, he greets the Noble Messenger m and says: “As-salaamu ‘alayka yaa Rasool-Allah, wa rahmatullaahi
wa barakaatuhu” (Peace be upon you,
O Messenger of Allah, and Allah’s mercy
and blessings).Then he offers salaat upon
the Prophet m (by saying: “Allaahumma
salli ‘aala Muhammad, etc). And one
may add, for example: As-salaamu ‘alayka yaa Nabiyy Allah, As-salaamu ‘alayka
yaa kheeratullaah min khalqihi, as-salaamu ‘alayka yaa Sayyid-al-Mursaleena
wa imaam-al-muttaqeena. Ash-hadu annaka qad balaghta ar-risaalatah wa addaytal-amaanah, wa nasahtal-ummah, wa
jaahadta fillaahi haqqa jihaadihi. Allaahumma salli ‘aala Muhammad wa ‘aala
aali Muhammad kamaa sallayta ‘aala
Ibraaheema wa ‘aala aali Ibraaheema,
innaka hameedun majeed. Wa baarik
‘aala Muhammad wa ‘aala aali Muhammad, kamaa baarakta ‘aala Ibraaheema
wa ‘aala aali Ibraaheema, innaka hameedun majeed.”(Peace be upon you, O
Prophet of Allah, peace be upon you, O
best of Allah among His creation, peace
be upon you, O Master of the Messen35
gers and the leader of the pious. I bear
witness that you have delivered the message, fulfilled the trust, advised the Ummah, and strived for the sake of Allah in
the best way possible. Oh Allah, praise
Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you praised Ibraaheem (Abraham) and the family of Ibraaheem, indeed, You are praiseworthy and glorious.
And bless Muhammad and the family of
Muhammad as you blessed Ibraaheem
and the family of Ibraaheem, verily, You
are praiseworthy and glorious).
3- Then he should take a step and greet Abu Bakr As-Siddiq.
4- Then he should take a step and greet ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab.
5- He must stand with respect and good
manners, and not raise his voice.
The Prophet m is revered, both alive
and dead.
Allah the Exalted has said:“O you who
believe! Lift not up your voices above
the voice of the Prophet, nor shout
when speaking to him as you shout
one to another, lest your works be rendered vain while you perceive not. Lo!
they who subdue their voices in the
presence of the messenger of Allah,
those are they whose hearts Allah has
proven unto righteousness. Theirs will
be forgiveness and immense reward.”
6- When greeting him, one should stand
as close to him as possible, facing the
grave.
7- His standing for greeting should only
be short, to also give other visitors the
opportunity to greet him, and so as not
to cause crowding and noise.
8- One should not wipe the grave or anything around it.
9- One should not ask the Prophet m to
fulfil his needs, relieve him of trouble,
or heal a sick person, because all of this
is only asked from Allah Almighty, the
Living who does not die. The Prophet
m came with Tawheed (monotheism)
and rejected shirk (polytheism)
10- After this, he should leave just
as he entered; with serenity and dignity, to make room
for those who are behind him
who have also come to greet
our Noble Messenger.






- The honourable Rawdah
The honourable Rawdah is part of
the Prophet’s Mosque. It is located
at the front of the mosque, and extends from the house of the Messenger of Allah m (the honorable room) to his pulpit
The Rawdah is a place of high rank,
with a great impact on the soul, in
which mercy and blessings descend.
This is where the Messenger of Allah
m and his companions used to pray,
supplicate, and remember Allah in all
their conditions.
It is the best part of the Prophet’s
honoured Mosque.
The Prophet m said: “What is between my house and my pulpit is one
of the gardens of Paradise.”















- How is the Rawdah one of the gardens of Paradise?
This place is similar to the Gardens of
Paradise in the attainment of happiness and tranquility for those who sit
in it.
The worship and prayer conducted in
this place are ways to lead to the garden of Paradise.












-How do I pray in the honourable Rawdah?
In view of the large number of people who
are eager to pray in the honourable Rawdah, and to reduce crowding, an order
has been arranged. So, whoever wants
to visit the Rawdah should book through
the official apps, in which times and places of entry are determined.








-Instructions for entering the Prophet’s Mosque
Most gates are wheelchair accessible.
Portable chairs are available for the
elderly and those who need them are
available next to the main gates inside
the mosque.


When you enter the
mosque, you can put your
shoes at the gate in designated places, or in the
boxes which can be found
everywhere inside the
mosque.
Remember the box number and do not forget it,
because there are similar
boxes all around.
It is courteous to others to ensure
you place your shoes in the designated areas rather than in the way
of other pilgrims. 


Usually there are places
to break the fast for fasting people on Mondays
and Thursdays inside the
Prophet’s Mosque.


All water available for drinking
in the Prophet’s Mosque is from
the well of Zamzam
And is transported to the Prophet’s
Mosque with the highest standards of

what benefits you, and beware of raising
your voice and laughing. Be careful not
to be distracted by your mobile phone

There are study circles spread inside
the Prophet’s Mosque; pilgrims can
join and learn the recitation and memorisation of the Qur’an amongst other
things, taught by specialized teachers.


In case you drop anything on the carpets or marble of the mosque which
causes it to become dirty, request the
help of a cleaner to remove it.


The corridors inside the mosque are
designated for walking and moving
groups of people, so performing your
prayers in them will obstruct free passage and will cause crowding.
In the mosque’s external squares, there

of going to external toilets.
Beware of slipping in the square, and wear
shoes that are slip resistant. 
Smoking is prohibited in the squares of
the Sanctuary.
Be careful not to stand further to the
front than the Imam during prayer in
the southern square of the mosque.
You can know the directions for aligning with the Imam, so as not to stand
further to the front than him, through
the signs in the square.
All the gates of the mosque are numbered with clear numbers next to each
gate, so you can reach the gate you want
by learning the gate number.
The gates of the squares of the Prophet’s Mosque are also numbered and are
written on the gates of the outer wall
of the squares of the mosque. They are
different from the numbers of the gates
of the Prophet’s Mosque
In case you need a health check, there
are two health centres on the squares
of the Sanctuary.


- Walking barefoot in the squares
If you lose your shoes or need to search
for them in the squares in the heat, try to
walk on the white marble only because it
is cool.
Beware of walking barefoot on black or
coloured marble, because this can be extremely hot and can lead to injuries

- Foreword

Ihraam is the first step in your journey of
pilgrimage, and it is an act of the heart with
which you enter into a great act of worship. Allah
commanded us to form sincere intentions for
Hajj and ‘Umrah and to establish them for His
sake, Glory be to Him, to the fullest extent. As
the Almighty said: “Perform the pilgrimage and
the visit (to Makkah) for Allah.”
Foreword

- What is Ihraam?
1- It is entering into the act of worship of Hajj
or ‘Umrah, which is done by forming the
intention to enter into the ‘Umrah or Hajj and
begin with the Talbiyah.

2- One has to declare the exact form of worship
that he intended at the beginning of his
Talbiyah, saying: “Labbayka ‘Umratan” or
“Labbayka Hajjan”. By he enters the state
of Ihraam and starts his worship of Hajj or
Umrah.

3- It is Sunnah for him to perform ghusl (bath) or
wudoo’ (ablution) before he intends to enter
Ihraam.

4- As soon as he has formed the intention, he
will have begun his rituals and must abstain
from all the prohibitions of Ihraam.



- The clothes of Ihraam

The person in Ihraam (Muhrim) wears a robe
which is wrapped around the lower part of
his body, and a robe which covers the top. Its
colour should be white.
He can use a buckle or belt which he wraps
around his waist to hold his Izaar (loincloth)
from falling and to keep his belongings,
phone, and money in.
All people are equal in their dress and
appearance, and are not separated by
colours or material things, and they stand
on equal footing, supplicating to Allah and
imploring Him.

Women take on the Ihraam in whatever
clothes they want, provided that they
are:
1- Loose and wide, covering everything
and not hindering movement.

2- It has no adornment which are
charming to men.





- Stipulation

If the pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah fears that
he will not be able to complete his rituals due to
a disease or a legitimate excuse or a reason outside of his control, then it is permissible for him to
stipulate the intention. He does so by saying this
after mentioning his ritual when saying “Labbayka
‘Umratan” or “Labbayka Hajjan”:
“If anything prevents me, then my place is where
You prevented me.”
(he can say this in any language he prefers).
Stipulation
If he says this and stipulates a condition,
and then something prevents them from
completing the ritual, it is permissible for
him to leave state of Ihraam, and there is
no atonement for him. 



- The Talbiyah
The Talbiyah is when you recite: “LabbaykAllaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka
laka labbayk. Innal hamda wan-ni’matah laka
wal-mulk, laa shareeka lak” (“At your service,
o Allah, at Your service! At Your service, there
is no partner for You, at Your service! Indeed
all praise and grace belong to You, and so does
the supreme authority, You have no partner.”)
And its meaning is: O Allah, we came,
answering Your call to perform Hajj time after
time, acknowledging You in monotheism and
worship, acknowledging Your grace and the
perfection of Your supreme authority. It is the
majestic motto of the pilgrims, which declares
servitude and obedience to the Creator, the
Blessed, Glory be to Him.
The men raise their voices and the women
whisper.

The Talbiyah starts from the beginning of
the Ihraam


And the Talbiyah ends:
- For the person performing Hajj:
When stoning the Jamrah of ‘Aqabah

- For the person performing ‘Umrah:
when seeing the House (Ka’bah).





- The Miqats
In veneration of the Sacred House of
Allah, the Messenger of Allah  specified
places before Makkah from which those
coming for Hajj and ‘Umrah must enter
the state of Ihraam. They begin reciting
the Talbiyah before they reach the
boundaries of the Sanctity (Haram).
These locations vary according to the
location one is travelling from.
Dhul Hulayfah
The pilgrim or the visitor who lives far
from Makkah is obliged to take on the
state of Ihraam from these Miqats or
what is adjacent to them and parallel to
them on their way, whether he travels
by plane or by land. One should not go
beyond these points without Ihraam.

Usually, planes coming to Jeddah
announce the timing of alignment with
the Miqat, so that pilgrims coming for
Hajj and ‘Umrah can enter into the state
of Ihram.


There are three types of people when it
comes to entering the state of Ihraam:

1- Whoever is in Makkah: He enters the state
of Ihraam to perform ‘Umrah from the
nearest place outside the Sanctity (Haram),
such as the mosque of the Mother of the
Believers ‘Aishah in At-Tan’im. One takes on
the state of Ihraam for Hajj from the place
where he is. 

2- Whoever is located between Makkah and
the Miqats: he takes on the state of Ihraam
for Hajj and ‘Umrah from the place where
he is. 

3- Whoever is in his place beyond the Miqats:
he must take on the state of Ihraam from the
Miqats or those adjacent to them for Hajj or
‘Umrah.


Dhul Hulaifa: The miqat for the people of
Madinah, which is 420 km (260 miles) from
Makkah.

Al-Juhfah: The miqat for the people of the
Levant and those on their way, and it is 187 km
(116 miles) from Makkah. Nowadays people
take on the state of Ihraam at 204 km (128
miles) from Rabigh.

Qarn Al Manazil: The miqat for the people of
Najd and those on their way, which is 94 km
(58 miles) from Makkah.

Yalamlam: The miqat for the people of Yemen
and those on their way, 115 km (71 miles) from
Makkah.

Dhat Irq :The miqat for the people of Iraq and
those on their way, and it is 92 km (57 miles)
from Makkah.







- Prohibitions for people in Ihraam

General prohibitions:
- Entering a marriage contract
- Killing game
- Shaving the head or clipping nails
- Applying perfume
- Sexual intercourse


Prohibitions for men:
- Covering the head
- Wearing clothes that consist of sewn joints

Prohibitions for women:
- Covering the face 

Things which are not forbidden in Ihraam:
- Washing yourself
- Wearing glasses, rings, and watches
- Bandaging a wound
- Wearing a belt and purse around the body
- Wearing sandals
- Carrying a parasol
- Women covering their face when they fear temptation


- Prevention of peeling skin and inflammation of the body folds after entering into the state of Ihraam

The problem of peeling skin and inflammation
of the body folds is common among pilgrims
performing Hajj and ‘Umrah, especially among
people with obesity or diabetes. The skin becomes infected and redness occurs in the folds
of the thighs, and sometimes in the armpits or
under the breasts, accompanied by annoying
and painful itching.

- How to prevent this? (Peeling skin)

1- Good ventilation of body folds such as
thighs and armpits.

2- Pay attention to personal hygiene and use
ointments on the body before walking.

3- When infected, use healing ointments and
wash the area well before applying the
medication.



- Etiquette for a person in the state of Ihraam
From the moment the pilgrim performing Hajj
and ‘Umrah enters into the state of Ihraam, he
is involved in a great act of worship and must
mind his words, actions and behaviour and
try to increase his rewards, as the Almighty
said: “The pilgrimage is (in) the well-known
months, and whoever is minded to perform
the pilgrimage therein (let him remember
that) there is (to be) no lewdness nor abuse
nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage.
And whatsoever good ye do Allah knoweth
it. So make provision for yourselves (Hereafter); for the best provision is to ward off evil.
Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of
understanding.” 

1- You have to renew your intentions and
sincerity to Allah the Exalted. The fact
that you came all the way to perform
Hajj is nothing but out of love for Allah
and response to His command, seeking
His mercy and reward, and fearing His
punishment. This is not for showing off or
out of arrogance, nor so that people can
say: “So-and-so performed Hajj”, nor to be
called a pilgrim with the nickname “Haaj”.

2- Make sure to learn the rulings on Hajj and
ask the people of knowledge in your group
about what confuses you. You will also find
in this guide all the information you need

3- Ensure you have good manners with people in general and with your Hajj companions in particular. This can happen through
them with the salaam, smiling at them, refraining from arguments, and and helping
and assisting them in what they need in
their affairs.

4- Tranquility and kindness in dealing with
the various situations that confront you,
as the Prophet said:“Allah is Gentle and
He loves gentleness, and rewards for
forbearance while He does not reward
severity, and does not give for any thing
besides it (forbearance).” 

5- Follow the instructions of the officials
and the group leaders to ensure a smooth
journey without annoying or disrupting
other people.




- What is Umrah?

Umrah is one of the best deeds and one
of the best acts which draw you closer to
Allah. When performing ‘Umrah, the pilgrim turns to the House of his Lord with his
heart, tongue, limbs, and seeks His mercy
and pleasure.



- The virtues of ‘Umrah

Here are some of the many virtues of ‘Umrah:
¨ It cleanses from sins and reduces poverty and need. The Prophet m said:
“Perform Hajj and ‘Umrah consecutively; for they remove poverty and
sin as the bellows removes impurity
from iron.”

¨ Repeating ‘Umrah expiates the sins
committed between them. The Prophet m said: “From one ‘Umrah to the
next is an expiation for what was committed between them.”




- Umrah in a nutshell
Umrah is an act of worshipping Allah by entering the state of Ihraam, circumambulating
the House, running between Safaa and Marwa, and shaving or trimming your hair.

1- A Muslim enters into the state of Ihraam
from the place specified for him by Islamic
law, and he abstains from the prohibitions
which he is prohibited from while in Ihraam.

2- He recites the Talbiyah, saying: “Labbayk-Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka
laka labbayk. Innal hamda wan-ni’matah
laka wal-mulk, laa shareeka lak” (“At your
service, o Allah, at Your service! At Your service, there is no partner for You, at Your service! Indeed all praise and grace belong to
You, and so does the supreme authority, You
have no partner.”)

3- He goes to the Sanctuary (Haram), circumambulating the Ka’bah seven times, with
the Ka’bah to his left. He begins at the Black
Stone and ends at the Black Stone.

4- He prays two rak’ahs after completion.

5- He heads to Safa, and from here he starts the
quest towards Marwah. If he reaches Marwah, he has completed one circuit. Then he
returns to Safa to complete the second circuit, and so on, until he completes 7 circuits,
ending in Marwah.

6- Men shave or trim their hair, and women
gather their hair and cut from its ends as
much as a fingertip (1-2 cm).

Thus, the ‘Umrah has been
completed and the Ihraam ends.





- What is Hajj At-Tamattu’?
Tamattu’ refers to a person who wishes to
perform Hajj and first enters into the state
of Ihraam to perform his ‘Umrah. Then, after
completing his ‘Umrah, he leaves the state of
Ihraam, only to re-enter the state of Ihraam
on the eighth of Dhul-Hijjah. In this way, he
has completely separated his ‘Umrah from
his Hajj.







- The ‘Umrah of the person who performs Hajj At-Tamattu


 The method of performing At-Tamttu:
¨ One takes on the state of Ihraam for ‘Umrah alone in the Hajj-months (Shawwal,
Dhul-Qi’dah and Dhul-Hijjah).

¨ When he reaches Makkah, he performs
Tawaf and performs Sa’i for his ‘Umrah,
shaves or trims his hair, and then leaves
his Ihraam.

¨ On the day of Tarwiyah (the 8th of DhulHijjah), he re-enters the state of Ihraam
for Hajj alone and performs all its actions.

- Important advices before arriving at the Sanctuary (Haram):

The pilgrim should not go to the Sanctuary (Haram) until after full coordination
with the official of the group with whom
he came, in order to know the exact time
for performing ‘Umrah. It is also important to clearly know the location of his residence, and to note the address of this
residence on his mobile phone or on a piece of paper.


.. In the event that you are coming to the
Sanctuary (Haram) via buses: Remember the bus stop and be sure of the meeting point after completing your ‘Umrah.

.. When you arrive at the squares around
the Sanctuary (Haram), you will find panels in front of the gates showing those
coming from far whether the gate is suitable for entry or exit.





- Escalators
You will usually need to use the escalators to go up or down in the Sanctuary
and its squares and services, so here are
the most important warnings for when
using the escalators:
1- Do not sit on the escalator, even if you are
tired.

2- Stand firmly on the escalator and hold your
hand on the moving belt.

3- Women should be careful that their hijabs
and jilbabs do not get stuck at the end of
the escalator.

4- Walk immediately after the escalator reaches the end so that people do not collide with you from behind.

5- Do not take wheelchairs onto the escalator,unless you do so with the help of a competent person.

6- If you have an elderly person or a person
who is not accustomed to taking the escalator, be by his side and hold him to protect
him from falling.

7- Do not push people or annoy the pilgrims if
there is crowding when going up or down,
and give all pilgrims an opportunity to get
on.

8- Do not place your foot on the side brush at
the bottom of the escalator, as this may injure you and disrupt the cleaning system of
the escalator.






- The circumambulation (Tawaf)
Circumambulation (Tawaf) is an act of
worship to Allah in which the Muslim
performs circumambulation around His
Holy House (the Ka’bah), worshipping
the Lord of the House and drawing close
to Him according to what He has prescribed.

Beginning and end of the circumambulation:
¨ The pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah
begins his circumambulation from the
corner where the Black Stone is. There is
a green sign indicating this on the upper
floors.
¨ The pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah
should do Takbir (saying “Allaahu Akbar”) in each round when he passes
the Black Stone, But it is not a condition
that the Takbir should be done exactly
at this point. It is not the case that it
is not valid to say the Takbir before or
after it; rather one can do Takbir somewhere near this point. So if the pilgrim
finds himself past the Black Stone, he
can still say Takbir. 

¨ He says the Takbir and points with his
hand to the Black Stone, then begins
his circumambulation with the Ka’bah
to his left (counterclockwise). Kissing
the Black Stone is a Sunnah for those
who are able to do so, but this is difficult during the festive seasons and
days with big crowds.

¨ He continues his circumambulation, supplicating Allah and praying
humbly to Him.

¨ If he reaches the corner which precedes the Black Stone,called the
Yamaani corner, it is desirable for
him to wipe over it if possible, even
though this will be difficult during
the Hajj season.

¨ Then he ends his circuit at the corner of the Black Stone, which is the
place from which he started. Here,
he points with his hand and says the
Takbir, and with this he has completed one circuit.

¨ He repeats this until he completes
7 circuits



- General tips while circumambulating:
¨ Stopping inside the square
of Tawaf causes crowding
and pushing.
¨ Do not go in the opposite
direction of the circumambulation, whatever the reasons.
¨ Avoid places with big crowds
and pushing.
¨ Be sure to wear a face mask,
and apply precautionary
measures

Special wheelchairs for circumambulation are available for the elderly and those who need them. 

Free wheelchairs can be found in the
following places:
1.Eastern Square (the entrance to mass
transit).
2.Southern Square (next to the King Abdulaziz Endowment, may Allah have
mercy on him).
Electric wheelchair:
An advanced means of transportation, aimed
at providing convenience to the Hajj- and
‘Umrah-pilgrims who need it during the performance of their rituals. These wheelchairs
come in several different sizes.

More than 5,000 regular wheelchairs, and
nearly 3,000 electric wheelchairs are available to those pilgrims and visitors who need
them, to facilitate their transportation.

Service locations for wheelchair pushers service:
1. The ground floor of the place of circumambulation.
2. The ground floor of the place of Sa’i (Gate 14).
3. The second floor of the place of Sa’i (The Al Arqam Escalators).
4. The King Abdulaziz Endowment, may Allah have
mercy on him.


The electric wheelchair service can be accessed from four entrances to the Sacred
Mosque, which are:
1. The eastern square (on the roof of Al-Qashashia).
2. The southern square (Ajyad Bridge leading to the first floor).
3. The escalator for the Ajyad gate.
4. The western square (Shbeika Bridge).
The electric carts are located on the first
mezzanine floor.

If you want to book an electric wheelchair before your arrival at the Sacred
Mosque:
You can book through the Tanaqol app.
the application, and the wheelchair will
be waiting for you at the following service
points:
¨ At the beginning of the Sa’i (Safa).
¨ The mezzanine floor (beginning of the circumambulation).


To make the best use of the wheelchairs,
we advise you to:
- Enter from the specified entrances.
- Stick to the wheelchair tracks.
- Follow the supervisors’ instructions.
- Maintain the safety of the wheelchair.
- Drive the wheelchair carefully and calmly.

A free golf cart service is available to
transport pilgrims, elderly worshippers, and people with special needs inside the Sacred Mosque.




- From the Sunnahs of Tawaf

Al-Ithtiba: This is a special way of wearing
the robe for a man, by which he brings out
his right shoulder, following the example of
the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.


Ar-Ramal: Ar-Ramal is the fast walking of
the man with small footsteps (not jogging)
during the first three circuits of his circumambulation if that is possible (without harming
the people around you). Then, the remaining four circuits are completed in a normal
walking pace.

Supplication (du’aa): Increase your supplications and invocations to Allah for what
matters to you and preoccupies your heart.
It is Sunnah to say at the last part of the circumambulation between the Yemeni Corner
and the Black Stone by reciting “Rabbanaa
aatinaa fid-dunyaa hassanatan wa fil aakhirati hassanah, waqinaa ‘adhaab-an-naar”
(“Our Lord, give us goodness in this world
and goodness in the Hereafter and protect
us from the punishment of the Fire”). 


- The two Rak’ahs of prayer after the circumambulation (Tawaaf)
If the pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah has
completed the seven circuits, he should cover his shoulder. Then, it is Sunnah for him to
pray two swift Rak’ahs behind the Maqaam
of Ibraahim according to the place designated by the responsible authorities, or he may
pray them anywhere in the Sacred Mosque
(Haram). Allah the Exalted said: “Take to
yourselves Abraham’s station for a place
of prayer.” [Surah Al-Baqarah, Aayah 125]


The right place to perform the two Rak’ahs
after circumambulation:
¨ The pilgrim prays them anywhere in
the sanctuary, according to the instructions of the policemen at that specific
time.
¨ But if it is easy for him to pray so that
the Maqaam of Ibraahim is in front of
him, even from a far place, then this
is desirable, because Allah the Exalted
says:“Take to yourselves Abraham’s
station for a place of prayer.”
¨ Beware of irritating the people circumambulating the Ka’bah or disrupting
their circumambulation, for the person circumambulating the Ka’bah has
priority and more right to be there. Allah mentioned them first in His Book
when He said: “Purify My house for
those who go around and those who
meditate therein and those who bow
down and prostrate themselves (in
worship).”

It is Sunnah to recite Surah Al-Kaafiroon in the first rak’ah and Surah
Al-Ikhlaas in the second.

¨ The Messenger of Allah m drank from
Zamzam after he finished his circumambulation, and it is Sunnah to follow
him in that. This is very easy nowadays
on your way to the Sa’i and inside the
place of Sa’i, as Zamzam water dispensers are spread throughout the Sacred
Mosque (Haram).










- As-Sa’i: how to reach the place of Sa’i

¨ When you finish your circumambulation, you will find inside the Sacred
Mosque guiding panels whichguide
you to the place of Sa’i and point towards Safa, where the starting point
of the Sa’i is.
We advise you, after you have completed the
circumambulation in the courtyard, to head
to the place of Sa’i on the upper floors:
¨ In order to avoid crowding on the ground
floor of the place for Sa’i.
¨ In order to make things easier for yourself and your Muslim brothers.
To go to the upper floors of the place for
Sa’i:
Head to the designated entrances by escalator (you can ask the security guards to show
you the way)





- Safa and Marwa
Safa and Marwa are two small mountains on
which Hagar (Umm Ismail), peace be upon
him, climbed in search of food or water.

Safa:
¨ A small hill from which the Sa’i begins.
¨ The rocks of the hill are still visible on the
ground floor of the place of Sa’i.


Marwa:
¨ A small hill where the Sa’i ends.
¨ The Sa’i of people performing Hajj and
‘Umrah ends here.


Sa’i between Safa and Marwa is one of
the indications of Hajj and ‘Umrah:
Allah the Exalted said:“Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwah are
among the indications of Allah.”




- A description of the Sa’i

The pilgrim worships his Lord by walking
the distance between Safa and Marwa
7 times, as his Noble Messenger m did.


One starts his Sa’i in Safa and ends it
in Marwa.

¨ Walking the distance from Safa to
Marwa is considered as one circuit.
¨ From Marwa to Safa is considered as
the second circuit, etc

The two green signs:
It is recommended (mustahabb) for men
who are able to, to run between the two
green signs, as did the Messenger of Allah.







- Supplication at the place of Sa’i

Supplication at the place of Sa’i:
The pilgrim should fill the entire time of
his Sa’i with remembering and supplicating Allah or with reciting the Qur’an.


Supplication at the beginning of Safa and Marwah:

When the Sa’i arrives at the beginning of Safa
or Marwah, it is Sunnah for him to raise his
hands towards the Qiblah at the beginning
of each circuit and supplicate to Allah by reciting “Allaahu akbar” before starting a new



The supplication of Allah’s Messenger:

When the Messenger of Allah first
reached Safa after the circumambulation,
he would recite the Words of Allah the Exalted:“Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and
Al-Marwah are among the indications
of Allah.” Then he said:“Begin with what
Allah begun with.” (meaning Safa before
Marwah).



When climbing up Safa and Marwa, the Prophet m used to face the Qiblah and recite:
“Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar,
laa ilaaha il-Allaah, wahdahu, laa shareeka
lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul-hamdu wa huwa
‘aala kulli shay’in qadeer. Laa ilaaha il-Allaahu
wahdahu. Anjaza wa’dahu, wa nasara ‘abdahu, wa hazamal-ahzaaba wahdahu.” (Allah is
greater, Allah is greater, Allah is greater. There
is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner
with Him. His is the Sovereignty, to Him praise
is due and He is Powerful over everything.
There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled
His promise, helped His servant and routed
the confederates alone).
After that he supplicates with whatever he
wishes, after that he repeats this remembrance, after that he supplicates with whatever he wishes, after that he repeats the remembrance, then he continues with his Sa’i.


The person performing Sa’i should not stop
to pray in a place which disrupts traffic and
causes crowding, and he must adhere to
the instructions of security personnel in the
Sanctuary.










- Some facts and figures about the Sa’i
The length of the place for Sa’i is 394 m
The average total length of the complete Sa’i is 2761.5 m
The average time to complete the Sa’i is between 55-45 minutes

Walking speeds vary according to several factors, such as: continuity, height, weight, age,
location, obstacles, crowding, and the duration of supplication.





- Several floors for performing Sa’i
The place for Sa’i is divided into different
floors with an area of 87,000 square metres (936,460 sq.ft.), which are:
¨ Basement.
¨ Ground floor.
¨ Mezzanine floor for electric wheelchairs.
¨ First floor.
¨ Second floor





- Answering pilgrims’ inquiries
Throughout the Sacred Mosque, there are
special telephones dedicated to answering
the questions and inquiries of pilgrims and
visitors in seven international languages.








- Barber shops
¨ There are many shops which are authorised to shave pilgrims and others
around the Sacred Mosque.
¨ They are equipped for a safe shave in
a healthy environment.
¨ For his own safety, the pilgrim must
go to one of these shops.
¨ Avoid going to the barbers on the
streets or cutting your hair in a manner which is inappropriate for the
sanctity and purity of the Sanctuary


To know the locations of the barber shops:
https://goo.gl/maps/pTJqBybHiiP6fWmTA





- Tips for a safe haircut
When at the barber, make sure of the
following:
¨ That he uses disposable razors with
plastic handles.
¨ That he changes the shaving tools and
brings out new ones after finishing
cutting the previous pilgrim.
¨ That he washes his hands with soap
and water before he starts shaving








- Repeating your ‘Umrah
It is recommended (mustahabb) to travel
again to perform ‘Umrah from time to time,
for those who are able. As the Prophet m
said: “From one ‘Umrah to the next is an expiation for what was committed between
them.”

But repeating the ‘Umrah in one and the
same trip was something not known among
the Companions, except for a reason. After
performing their ‘Umrah, they used to perform a lot of acts of worship, such as reciting
the Qur’an and praying.
However, if it brings ease to the pilgrims, it
is permissible to repeat the ‘Umrah on the
same trip, for oneself or for others, if that
does not cause hardship for the pilgrims.

Whoever wishes to perform ‘Umrah must
obtain permission from the official applications to perform ‘Umrah at the time specified for him.


Whoever wants to perform ‘Umrah and takes
the official permit, must leave the boundaries
of the Sanctuary (Haram) to enter the state
of Ihraam from there. He can, for example,
go out to the mosque of ‘Aishah - may Allah
be pleased with her - in Al-Tan’im and enter
Ihraam from there.

To see how to reach the mosque of 'Aisha: https://goo.gl/maps/m5GQV5dMoSxnRLYU6

Being satisfied with performing only one
‘Umrah during very busy seasons and days
helps reducing stampedes and leaves an
opportunity for other pilgrims who were
unable to perform ‘Umrah to perform their
‘Umrah with peace of mind.









- Health tips
To regulate body temperature, avoid fatigue and compensate for the loss of body
fluid:
We recommend drinking generous amounts
of Zamzam water, bottled water, and juices.


To protect the feet when walking on
tiles:
¨ Take a break when you feel tired.
¨ Avoid walking barefoot for a long time.
¨ Do not walk barefoot on the tiles of
the outer squares.



How do I protect myself from peeling
skin?
¨ Clean and shower before Umrah.
¨ Use ointments for the folding skin of
the thighs (available at pharmacies).
¨ Apply anti-fungal powder.











- Shopping centres around the Sanctuary (Haram)
There are a number of shopping centres and restaurants near the Sanctity (Haram), including:

1- Makkah Towers
2- The King Abdul Aziz Endowment
3- Jabal Umar Towers
4- Al-Khalil Square








- Performing ‘Umrah in Ramadan
Umrah has great virtues at all times. It is
one of those deeds which expiate sins, as
the Prophet peace be upon him, informed us. But during
Ramadan, ‘Umrah has a special virtue.

The reward for performing ‘Umrah in Ramadan:
The Prophet m said: “...For an ‘Umrah in
Ramadan equals Hajj (in reward).”













- Umrah permit
The pilgrim must, before traveling to perform ‘Umrah, make sure that he meets
the requirements in order to be issued
with an ‘Umrah permit.
He can obtain the permit and verify it
through these two apps:
Eatmarna App and Tawakkalna App



To issue an ‘Umrah permit, all you have
to do is follow these steps:
1- Select the desired service, and choose the day and time.
2- Your identity will be verified.
3- After that, the permit will be issued according to the available date.



In order for the ‘Umrah-pilgrim to complete the rituals with ease, he must commit to performing them on the specified
times.
These times will appear when obtaining
the ‘Umrah permit.



Choosing the times when there is less
crowding helps one to complete the ‘Umrah with reverence and tranquility.











- Checklist
1- Obtain the ‘Umrah permit.
2- Take a rest.
3- Take your usual medication.
4- Carry emergency medication with you if needed.

-Addoho Neighborhood(A living Najdi heritage)
 
One kilometer southwest of the Palace of Government, Addoho Neighborhood is located in the heart of the capital, Riyadh. It is the last old neighborhood to preserve its traditional Najdi architecture. The construction of Addoho goes back more than 200 years. With its strategic location within the Palace of Government area, its narrow alleys and the details of its houses that reflect the way of life of the locals at the time, Addoho Neighborhood tells the story of a desert civilization whose buildings were surrounded by walls and palm trees.
Addoho Neighborhood – Back to the Roots
 
The old neighborhoods in Riyadh were characterized by the style of Najdi architecture, which gained its urban identity from its geographical environment. Addoho Neighborhood is near Wadi Hanifa and agricultural palm oases abound around it. Local materials were commonly used in the construction of houses and buildings. Stones were used in the foundations of buildings and mud was used to build the walls. When visiting the Addoho Neighborhood, it can be seen that some of the neighborhood's walls are round, due to their location at pedestrian intersections. Inscriptions and decorations are the most prominent feature in the old Najdi houses, so the edges of the doors are covered with plaster and decorated with triangles, holes and geometric shapes, which expresses the spatial connection of its inhabitants with their land and civilization.
The location of Addoho Neighborhood
 
In the 1950s, the neighborhood was in the center of the city of Riyadh, before the area of urbanization expanded to the north of the city. The neighborhood was called Addoho because it was crowded with people. The neighborhood was divided into private properties and public endowments, including millstone mills and wheat pestles. Wheat is one of the most important crops used in the local cuisine in Riyadh.
Addoho Neighborhood today
 
The neighborhood was rehabilitated and restored to preserve an ancient heritage that reflects the civilizational shift of the capital, Riyadh. It was officially opened to visitors in March 2023. After restoration, the neighborhood includes a mosque, traditional residential units, a traditional restaurant, as well as various cafes and shops.

-Historic Jeddah

Before naming it as the royal seaport for Makkah at 657 AD, the Al-Balad site, “Historic Jeddah”, was built on beautiful coastal land. It gathered people from all cultures and walks of life throughout the ages.

Next in importance comes “Bab Makkah” from the east side facing Souq Al Badu intended to protect this market and form a passage.

Bait Sallom
 
Bait Sallom has turned into ‎"House of Jeddah and Our Good Days" museum. It has wonderfully preserved all its belonging as if it was a time capsule for Al-Balad area.

This is a great stop in your journey to witness the classic Hejazi architectural designs and the impact of time on them.
Al-Mimar Mosque and Ain Farag Yosr

An ancient well lined up from the inside and outer area with Al-Mangabi Stones, excavated from the ‎Red Sea waters, is directly connected to the mosque. The well was responsible for its water supply. When the water became scares in the well, water was brought from the spring “Ain Farag Yosr”. Travelers pay it a visit for its historical status, to pray in it, and to enjoy its architectural artistic design.
The spring “Ain Farag Yosr” was intended initially to supply the old "Al-Mazloum and Al-Yaman " neighborhoods in Historic Jeddah. Since dug, it supplied water until it completely dried on 1304AH.

The charm of local drinks

It's the special way the locals in Hijaz developed to express their love of life and very friendly gatherings. These drinks vary in color, consistency and ingredients in an effort to match the diversity of cultures within this great city.  

Exotic malt drink
 
Subia is the most famous traditional beverage in Jeddah, which is made with malt and very special ingredients. It is a sweet, cold, summer drink that has a distinctive velvety texture. The way you prepare it extends for days, and it's served either in ruby red or faint white. It is considered the spirit drink of this city; it's irresistible and will be reason enough to repeat your visit to Jeddah. Come try it at Alkhudari Subia.

Warm milk drinks
 
Milk here is treated as special as precious jewelry. It is added to hot drinks; and specifically, it's an essential ingredient in the warmest and most cozy drinks. Yes! That's certainly what you'll have when you try the famous Sahlab made with sugar, hot milk, cardamom, and crushed nuts. Don't miss trying it at Barnes cafe.
If your trip to Jeddah coincides with the Hijri New Year, you must be lucky enough to taste the amazing milk drink served at that time of year, called, "almond coffee".

You can try it as well as other local juice options at Juice World.



Jeddah’s freshest seafood:
 
Offering the best wake-up call in Jeddah, the bustling Central Fish Market comes to life at daybreak, selling row upon row of colorful produce fresh from the sea. As the sun rises over the coast, watch fishermen offload their hauls onto over 100 stalls, as buyers jostle to bid on the widest selection of fish in Saudi Arabia.
Visitors looking to try this noisy, immersive experience will enjoy the full-service offering that sees fish cleaned, prepped and cooked just hours after being caught. But the good-natured din and vibrant array of fresh catches – not to mention the port’s fascinating role in Jeddah’s history – makes the market a photogenic feast even if you’re not eating.
The port has been the beating heart of Jeddah for centuries, playing an integral role in the city’s formation and development. As a global trading hub and a welcoming passage for pilgrims heading to the holy cities of Makkah and Medina, its prime location has helped the city to thrive.
Even today, it remains the Middle East’s second-largest and second busiest trading seaport. And though the tankers that frequent Jeddah’s shores these days are greatly changed from the wooden dhows of eras past, the azure blue walls of the fish market have lost none of their characters.
Bagging a bargain
 
With many vendors displaying English-language labels, it’s a good idea to browse from stall to stall and get accustomed to the colorful variety of seafood on offer.
From local favorites including the red grouper ('najil’) and the Napoleon wrasse (‘tarabani’), to seabass, tuna, calamari, and mountains of crab and lobster, you’ll not be short of choice. Egyptian parrotfish and Omani sardines are among the catches from elsewhere in the region, but if you’d prefer to try only local fare then look for those labeled ‘baladi’.
Haggle your price with the vendor – usually given by the kilo – take your newly-bought goods and follow signs for the “peel section”, found behind the market towards the water’s edge. It’s likely others will be headed the same way, carrying bags of shellfish or lugging a hefty fish in each hand, ready to transfer the task of cleaning, gutting, and filleting over to an army of willing workers.
Your fish will be weighed and priced before you enter the busy cleaning arena to wait in line. Once your shrimps are swiftly peeled or your salmon expertly filleted, you’re only moments away from tucking in.
Cooked to order
 
The fish market’s on-site restaurant means you can enjoy your new catch as you prefer, with takeaway and eat-in options. Simply head in and advise how you’d like it cooked (grilled or fried) and choose from sides that include salad, hummus, and baba ghanoush.
If attending early in the morning, the restaurant can store your fish until you return for lunch
Also at the market
 
The number of on-site fishing shops makes the market a hub for amateur anglers, with fishing rods, tackle, and other equipment available for anyone inspired to have a go themselves. Coffee and snack stalls are dotted outside the main market area, while parking is available on-site along with an ATM.
Although early mornings are the most popular time to visit, the fish market is open all day, every day, from 5 am to 9 pm. For the most frenzied activity, turn up on Friday mornings when the weekend begins with a cacophonous display of Jeddah’s passion for seafood.

Meat Restaurants:


Experience meat the local way
 
Jeddah's cuisine can be considered as one of the world's most diverse cuisines in concepts and cooking methods and techniques. Meat here is not traditional at all. There is more than one way to cook meat, as it is considered a staple in Jeddah's Hijazi cooking culture. You can have it in a number of ways, each reflecting the culture of a particular region. Over the years, people have shared their own ways of developing techniques of cooking meat and serving it.
Meat on Stone
 
The method of cooking meat on a stone is referred to as Madh’bi, and it is one of the well-known staples in Saudi culture. You can ask an expert chef to help you prepare it as you will experience this method while enjoying the dish outdoors on an unforgettable road trip. You can try it at Asl Almadh’bi restaurant.

Meat with Herbs
 
For this dish, we will rely a lot on nature. This method of meat preparation is known as Alhaneeth. It's prepared by covering the meat with a wild plant known as Markh, and cooked in an iron pot referred to as Mifa, or in a sandpit that is specifically dug to cook it. The extraordinary taste of flavors will sure impress you and the final result is worth waiting for. You can enjoy it at Bilmarkh Restaurant.
Mandi
 
This idea of cooking meat may seem unfamiliar to you at first, but it will result in one of the most impressive dishes. Mandi is a Saudi dish associated with joyful occasions. You will enjoy observing the way Mandi is prepared, where the main technique for preparing it is to cook meat in a Tannour, which is a special type of oven, or in a hollow hole underneath the ground, then covered by mud on all sides. You can try this dish at Alsaddah Restaurant.


Jeddah Local Cuisine:
 
Due to its geographical status and the commercial movement, Jeddah surprises its visitors with the various dimensions of flavors it has to offer. Jeddah has become a popular eatery that is associated with the culture of the region and a major part of its household tables.  

Treasures of the Red Sea await you
 
You'll be able to taste the best food if you’re trying to limit your carbon footprint and become a more sustainable traveler. This coastal city is a paradise for seafood lovers, where travelers always flow to taste the most famous seafood such as najil, hamour, hareed, and saijan. Twina’s restaurant is your best option for eating the finest seafood.

Taste lies in the history of local food
 
In Jeddah, you will be able to experience very high quality food that can't be found in other cities, as it is known for integrating world cultures into cooking. There are many unique options for breakfast. Here you can try the “tateemah” and it doesn’t get more authentic than having it in: Stita restaurant as well as Maqadeer restaurant. You should not miss trying out the famous “tamees bread” and “foul with ghee” in their traditional way in several restaurants offering it with unique and modern recipes such as: Ful 21, Tamees09, Meez and Taibat Al Hijaz.

Optimal Reflection of International Dishes
 
If you've ever tried bread pudding somewhere around the world, you should try “masoub” in Abu Zaid, one of the oldest Saudi restaurants that specialize in traditional masoub and mutabbag.


International cuisines in Jeddah:

You can indulge in cuisines from all around the globe right here in the marvelous coastal city of Jeddah.  The locals have a distinctive taste in food, which turned the city into a desired destination for international food chains, offering a variety of delicious American, Asian, Indian, Italian, and Mexican dishes.

The Yemeni Village
Yemeni cuisine is a key component of Jeddah’s food scene. Until recently, though, it was mainly served from small, backstreet restaurants, or as takeaway. The Yemeni Village, with its three-floor restaurant – designed to look like a traditional Yemeni clay house – has brought it into the mainstream. Choose from the menu’s many maghash dishes, which are meat-based and cooked in a traditional stone pot; or spicy, shakshouka eggs. We recommend the fahsa – slow-cooked marinated meat that’s buttery and tender. All orders are served with malawah-style buttery layered bread. As for dessert, try the deliciously calorific marsa, which is a mix of bananas, dried bread, honey, and cream. And then head straight for the gym.
