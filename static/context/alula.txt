Exploring AlUla
There are few places in the world where you can still feel like a true explorer charting the unknown. In many historic destinations, the illusion of discovery is promptly shattered by a jungle of selfie sticks. But in AlUla, which is home to Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, deep in the desert in the northwestern region of the country, you might still be able to play out your fantasy of being an intrepid archaeologist for a day. Despite all the makings of a bucket list-topping global destination — ancient tombs that remain as the legacy of 7,000 years of human civilisation, stunning natural rock formations and canyons, a plethora of adventure sports options and cutting-edge art installations — AlUla remains largely off the global tourism radar, giving you plenty of space and time for reflection with the monumentality of its beautiful desert landscapes.

Here’s a checklist of must-see natural wonders that are bound to make your imagination wander:

Elephant Rock (Jabal AlFil)
Elephant Rock (Jabal AlFil), is an amazing geomorphological wonder located 11km northeast of AlUla. A spectacular example of natural erosive forces of water and wind over a period of millions of years, this natural wonder rises 171ft into the air with mountains looming in the background.

Raqasat (Dancing Rocks)
Jabal Al Rukkab, located in the Ragasat Valley, features spectacular pieces of natural art including fantastic rock formations, a network of canyons and the labyrinth of valleys running through the massif. Among these, discover a silhouette of three spiraling rock formations that are dubbed as the Raqasat (Dancing Rocks), which are sculpted by sand blown by fierce winds.
If you crave more adventure, discover the 2,000-year-old petroglyphs on the rocks in Jabal Al Rukkab.

Harrat Uwayrid
Towering mesas with wide expanses of igneous basalt columns in the west add to the aesthetics of AlUla. This iconic landscape was formed over the years by a then-active volcano.

The AlUla Oasis
Nestled within the Wadi AlQura (or Valley of Villages) is the heart of the region. The AlUla Oasis is a lush haven that offers cool respite with its famous date palm groves and aromatic citrus trees along with harvests of wheat, barley, olives, figs, and oats. The AlUla Valley thrives due to the drainage basin and the oasis's natural springs.

Stargazing at AlGharameel
Surrounded by unique natural rock formations, AlGharameel is located deep in the desert, far from city lights. Gaze up and dine under the stars in this unforgettable experience.
