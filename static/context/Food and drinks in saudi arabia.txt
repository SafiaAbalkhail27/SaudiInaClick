Food and drinks in saudi arabia

KSA’s national beverage
Qahwa 101: How is Saudi coffee made?
While coffee is now enjoyed in almost every part of the world, the beverage first gained popularity in the Middle East. Some food historians trace its origins back more than 1,000 years, when legend has it a ninth-century Ethiopian goat herder noticed the energizing effect that the bright red berries of a certain bush had on his flock. (For the uninitiated, what we call a coffee bean is actually the seed of a cherrylike fruit). So he chewed on the fruit himself. In his euphoric state, the herder decided to bring the berries to a nearby monastery. But the monk to whom he gave the berries disapproved of their use as a stimulant and threw them into the fire. This, in turn, released an enticing aroma, which attracted the other monks in the monastery, who quickly salvaged the roasted beans from the embers, ground them and dissolved them in hot water, and the rest is, well, history.

Coffee eventually made its way to Makkah and Egypt, then to Turkey in the mid-16th century, and finally to Europe. Perhaps because of its long history in the region, coffee is a symbol of hospitality throughout the Middle East. “It is the first beverage offered to any Saudi guest,” says Majed Al Muhanna, a heritage food documenter. It is served at events, social gatherings and weddings, and in private homes, offices and, of course, cafés.

Saudi coffee — or qahwa, as it is known in Saudi Arabia — generally (though not always) refers to coffee made of arabica beans. Although it’s often compared to Turkish coffee, Saudi coffee is known less for its thickness as it is for its “richness in taste because of the use of spices,” Al Muhanna says — and the manner in which it’s served.

How Saudi Coffee Is Made: The Dallah Set
Saudi coffee is made from coffee beans that may be roasted very lightly or heavily. While coffee brewing methods vary, Saudi coffee is usually boiled and served unfiltered (read: black). Sugar is not typically added, but depending on where you are in the kingdom, your coffee may be brewed with saffron, cinnamon, cardamom or cloves. As for the service, a coffee pot called a dallah is used to serve a small amount of coffee at a time, just covering the bottom of the cup (which is called a finjal). Unless you gesture to the contrary, your host or waiter will continue to pour you small amounts at a time. To balance its bitter flavor, coffee is usually served with something sweet, such as dates, nuts or candied fruit.

Regional Differences
“The further north you go in the kingdom, the darker the color of the coffee becomes,” says Al Muhanna, referring to the roasting preferences of each region. The spices can influence the color of the brew, too. “In the southwestern regions, they use a spice mixture that’s different from the center and north of the country,” he adds. There is even a type of coffee produced from the shells of coffee beans, which is served in the southern regions of the kingdom. “This coffee tends to be greenish brown because of the use of the coffee bean shells and ‘nakhwah’ spicing,” Al Muhanna says.

Is Saudi Coffee High in Caffeine?
Yes. That said, you’re apt to drink small amounts at a time. “The coffee produced in the southern regions tends to be lower in caffeine,” Al Muhanna says. And while many coffee-drinking nations focus their consumption in the early part of the day, Saudis may drink coffee late into the night. “The optimum time would be in the afternoon before sunset, to re-energize after a long day,” Al Muhanna says.

Traditional foods in Saudi
8 regional must-try eats
Food is a focal point of travel, especially when you take time to get to know a place through its cuisine. Plan a trip to Saudi Arabia, and your taste buds won’t be disappointed at breakfast, lunch, dinner or dessert.


A Traditional Saudi Breakfast

Kick off your day with a traditional Saudi breakfast. Opt for a classic, simple spread, such as flatbread, cheese and date jam, or try the savory shakshuka or the sweet Saudi banana masoub.

Shakshuka
Sample alternative image text
Shakshuka: This breakfast dish of poached eggs cooked with a tomato and onion sauce is savory and spicy too, thanks to ingredients such as cayenne, chili and cumin. Shakshuka gets its name from the Arabic word “shakka,” which means “stick together,” and it refers to how well the eggs, tomatoes and other ingredients do just that. Easily made in one pan, shakshuka is popular throughout the Middle East and northern Africa.

 
Saudi Banana Masoub: Made with overripe bananas, ground flatbread and cream or milk, masoub is similar to banana bread. The dish is topped with a variety of treats, most commonly nuts (specifically almonds), honey and raisins.


Lunch in Saudi Arabia
 
“In Middle Eastern culture, lunch is the main meal of the day,” says Majed Al Muhanna, a heritage food documenter in Saudi Arabia. Al Muhanna says traditionally a cold, liquid yogurt called laban is consumed at lunch (especially in central Saudi Arabia). “Yogurt is never between meals. It’s with lunch,” he says. In addition to drinking leben, midday is the ideal time to try some of Saudi’s most popular entrees, including its national dish: kabsa.

Kabsa: Stemming from the Arabic word “kbs,” which means “pressed,” kabsa features ingredients that are pressed (cooked) together in one pot. A regional lunchtime favorite, kabsa is the national dish of Saudi Arabia. It can be prepared with a variety of ingredients, but the three staples are rice, vegetables and meat. In Saudi, the dish’s meat could be beef, goat, lamb, chicken or, on occasion, camel. Cloves, cinnamon, saffron, cardamom, bay leaves, black pepper, nutmeg and loomi (sun-dried black limes) are used to flavor the dish.

Matabaq: Matabaq is made with stretchy dough similar to roti and resembles a stuffed and fried pancake. The name of this dish means “folded” in Arabic, and it refers to the way the dough is folded around its fillings, including meat, garlic, eggs, curry, peppers, ghee, onions, mint and coriander. Though the exact origin is not clear, the dish is said to have been invented in Yemen and Saudi Arabia around the same time and was influenced by the Indian population in both countries. Find it fresh from food stands across Saudi.


Dinner in Saudi Arabia
 
Traditionally, dinner is a lighter meal, but Al Muhanna says this is changing. With both men and women working, and workdays getting longer, dinner is becoming more like lunch, he says. Here are two Saudi Arabian traditional foods to finish off the day.

Jareesh: One of the oldest dishes in Saudi Arabia, jareesh (also known as harees) consists of boiled crushed wheat, onion, rice, meat, broth and spices, such as parsley, cumin and coriander. The final product, which is especially popular during the month of Ramadan, has a consistency somewhere between porridge and a dumpling.

Thareed: Even older than jareesh, thareed is said to date back to pre-Islamic times and to have been a favorite dish of the Prophet Muhammad. Similar to a lamb stew with a kick of spice, thareed is made by stewing halal meats and vegetables and is served over a thin piece of bread.


Middle Eastern Desserts in Saudi
If there were ever a time to eat dessert, it’s on vacation — especially in Saudi, where there’s a wide variety of traditional sweets, from pastries to buttermilk cookies.

Umm Ali: Almost everyone loves Umm Ali, also spelled Om Ali, which translates to “Ali’s mother.” Popular across the region, this pastry is filled with honey, nuts, cinnamon and milk and is baked until golden brown. Find it at many dessert cafés across the country.

Ma’amoul: Stuffed with pistachios, walnuts, almonds and, of course, dates (and sometimes date pudding), ma’amoul has a crumbly, shortbread-like exterior that melts right in your mouth. These adorable cookies are made with a wooden mold to get their signature pattern, and they smell of the cinnamon and cardamom that’s baked inside. Ma’amoul are often served during celebrations in Saudi Arabia.

Vibrant scenes that come before you.
The popular cuisine in Abha 

Discover the best flavours in the following list of the popular dishes in Abha. The preparation of these diverse and highly nutritious dishes portrays a vibrant scene. Moreover, it is a living extension of Asir province, which has long been and remains one of the most regions in Saudi Arabia in preserving its traditional dishes and their methods of preparation. Accordingly, Asir has won the title of World Culinary Arts Zone at the International Institute of Gastronomy, Culture, Arts and Tourism (IGCAT), and shall be awarded in 2024.

The ingredients of the popular cuisine in Abha reflect the human relationship with the plains, mountains and food resources. The most important of which are honey of all kinds, coffee, lamb and goats, and most importantly, the whole wheat flour; which is included in the preparation of more than 10 popular dishes in the region. Following are some of the most popular dishes in Abha:

Heneeth
Heneeth is a dish associated with the well-known sala and markh trees in Asir. It is one of the most famous dishes in the province. Heneeth is often prepared outdoors, in an iron pot or in a sand pit referred to as "mahnaz". After igniting the firewood in the pit, the heat reaches a high and balanced degree to complete the process of cooking the meat in the best condition. To prepare the recipe, a layer of markh plant is put in the iron pot then the meat pieces that are covered with another layer of markh. Finally, with a piece of cloth is placed on the top before the heneeth is tightly covered. The process of cooking takes between two  to three hours. At last, you can enjoy  heneeth which is usually served with rice. Many restaurants in Abha offer Haneeth in its traditional way of preparation. You can try it at Haneeth Ali Ramzi Restaurant near Talal Maddah Theater.

Aseeda and Areeka 
Aseeda "Porridge" consists of whole wheat flour that is cooked until it becomes thick. And for a savoury taste, some spices can be added to the porridge. It is typically served with soup and yoghurt. To enjoy the traditional way of eating aseeda, you should try eating it by hand with three fingers. You should take into consideration that despite the simplicity of its final shape, it is considered one of the most important recipes that are prepared by hand and require physical effort. As for the arika, it is easier to prepare than aseeda, because it consists of a liquid dough grilled on the griddle, then served in a dish with the addition of ghee and honey in the middle of the dish. Finally, it is decorated with dates on the side.

Tasabea
Tasabea is often prepared at traditional events and celebrations. It relies, in its way of preparation, on milk and water; to which flour cooked on fire is added to be cooked until done. At the end, it is served with margarine, cooked with stone or what is known as radfa, in its center.

Mashgotha
Mashgotha is one of the most popular dishes prepared in winter. It is prepared by cooking yoghurt with flour until they form a thick mixture. Radifa comes on the top of them with the additional serving of pieces of beeswax. Small pieces of dough known as "kart" can be added as desired.

Miva bread
Miva bread completes most of the Asiri dishes. Miva is baked in an oven known as Tanour, after its left to ferment for a long time. Miva dough is then spread out into an oval shape. Miva is similar to several Saudi pastries, such as: Southern bread and Khmer bread.

************************************

Medina on a Plate
Must try local flavors
A feast of locally grown produce
Despite growing leaps and bounds from its humble origins, Medina still retains its historic character as an oasis town. Medina's cuisine is all about locally grown produce, be it the dates, herbs, or even the famed mint leaves. The city's cuisine uses these ingredients in different recipes, in one way or another.
Shorbat Hub
Meat and tomatoes pair well in a soup, and that's the combination that Shorbat Hub promises. Hub translates to grains in a traditional Hijazi home. The air feels filled with comfort and warmth when a bowl of Shorbat Hub is placed on the table. It's usually served with vinegar and onion sauce.


Medini Rice
The rice has a slightly sweet tang due to the massive amounts of raisins and carrots used in its preparation. It is often served with rotisserie chicken on top with a side of duggus (tomato salsa). This rice dish is a city favorite that you must try.

Makhtoom Bamia Okra with Yogurt and Saffron
The meat is fried with spices like cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, black lemon, and onions until they soften. After which, garlic, hot pepper, then tomato are added into the mix. The dish's star is the delicious okra that cooks with the meat for a hearty plate.

Samboosak Buff
The buff is a semi-circular samosa that is stuffed with different fillings but the most popular being minced meat. It is a staple on the Ramadan table and often eaten upon breaking one's fast.
 
Buraik
Buraik is a layered dough pastry made with different fillings, the most common being cheese and mint. It is baked in an oven that creates its crispy exterior while being soft and gooey inside.

Shurek
A bread that is very similar to a bagel, you don't have to wait for breakfast to have it, as it can accompany your evening tea equally well. 

Baladi Salad
This salad is a mishmash of the easiest veggies that one can lay their hands on – think tomatoes, cucumber and parsley. It's generally not accompanied by any dressing that gives it a very raw taste.

Spinach Kebabs
This kabab does the unthinkable—it adds a vegetable and even rice to a kebab. But surprisingly, spinach, rice, and minced meat pair perfectly well together.

Jobnya
In the Hijaz region, the variety of sweets is mind-boggling. Those fond of sweets will find themselves going to sweet shop after sweet shop to discover something new. Once you've had your first bite of this crunchy sweet pastry, you'll find yourself craving for more.

Lahoh
While this pancake type bread isn't exclusive to Medina as it's also popular in Somalia on the other side of the Red Sea, it has become a staple of the city's cuisine.

Turomba
Turomba is a dessert usually eaten after a large meal, like Mandi or Kabsa. It's light and doughy from the inside yet has a crunchy texture from the outside. The dessert also pairs perfectly with hot tea.

Red Tea With Mint
Red tea with mint may seem like a staple found anywhere else, but the specialty here lies in the mint used in it. Madinah's mint is well-known for its intense aroma. Visitors to the city can often carry bundles back with them. Twigs of locally grown mint are added to red tea giving it a strong minty flavor, which is believed to aid in digestion.

Saudi Southern Goodness
A Taste of Jazan
Jazan owes its rich culinary cuisine to its eclectic geographical resources. Acres of arable land, agreeable climate, and topographical diversity make it a pivotal agricultural heartland where a myriad of vegetables and tropical fruits are harvested. This coastal city also boasts a wealth of seafood. A festival is held annually in early spring where local fishermen go out and trawl the abundant Parrot Fish in the adjacent Red Sea. Gaming and beekeeping industries have also left defining imprints on the hearty Southern cuisine of Jazan.

Several dishes are named after stone or clay pots used in their preparation. Traditionally, the cookware was crafted from scratch by family matriarchs. Nowadays, they can be purchased from various artisanal markets across the country. Maghsh, for example, is a hallmark dish: beef stew with vegetables such as potatoes, okra, tomatoes, and zucchini. But Maghsh is also the name of the stone pot used for cooking the dish, which is somewhat similar to Korean dolsot. Used to prepare almost all of the enticing dishes, the presence of a special tannour oven called Mifa is commonplace in Jazani households.

Heading straight to mains, here’s a selection of delectable entrées, passed down from one generation and on to the next:

Samak Mkashan: Hamour fish seasoned with spices alongside vegetables and grilled on an ember fire.
Mahshoosh: Particularly consumed during Eid Al-Adha, this dish is made of lamb cutlets pan-fried in fat and seasoned with cinnamon and salt.
Mafalet (Thareed): There are two kinds of Mafalet: sweet and sour. The sweet kind is made with millet or corn paste, fresh cow’s milk, ghee, and sugar. The sour kind is made in the same way but fermented.
 

Khameer and Lahooh are Jazani staple sides. Both are types of sour bread made of ground wholewheat or corn that’s left to ferment for several days, giving it a distinct tangy taste. Lahooh is flatter, almost as thin as crepe. They are usually enjoyed fresh out of the oven, dunked in stews or yoghurt, or covered in butter, ghee or honey.

Ending on a sweet note, the most famous Jazani dessert is called Marsah. It’s a hefty mix of bread and banana chunks, topped off with honey and ghee. Southern Arabic coffee, Gahwa Gishr, which is typically made by brewing coffee bean husks with cardamom and ginger, perfectly concludes meals meant for indulgence.

************************************

The Culinary Catch of Yanbu
If there is one place that brings people together, it's the dinner table. And on this particular occasion, we're talking about the Yanbu spread. 

Due to its location and proximity to the sea and neighboring countries, its cuisine is a mix of Arabic dishes with a seafood twist. It gives Yanbu’s culinary offerings a flavor profile that is familiar yet unique from that of most Saudi Arabia. 

Though varied, the cuisine in Yanbu has not changed much throughout the years, except for a handful of new dishes being adapted into its repertoire.

The Culinary Catch of Yanbu
One of the celebratory dishes that is a must-have on an Eid breakfast table is the dipyaza. This dish is perhaps the Arabic version of a bowl of muesli. It usually contains all or some of the following: dried apricots, apricot nectar, coarse sugar, ghee, cardamom, cinnamon, mixed nuts, and other dried fruits (such as dates, raisins, and figs).

However, if you find yourself breaking bread on a typical Yanbu morning, then more likely it will be with fatoot. This bread is light and crisp and is said to originate from Madina, but it has become a staple breakfast item. Its main component is yogurt.

With its proximity to the Red Sea, it's only fitting that Yanbu cuisine would have seafood as the star of its classic recipes. Deemed as the most famous dish on this side of the coast is the siyadiah. A traditional plate of fish and spiced rice, it is shared by the Northern region of Saudi and bordering countries. However, Yanbuans have a distinct take on it based on their spices and the in-season fishes available.

The region also has its local version of the renowned Saudi kabsa, using conch (a type of seashell) as the star of the dish. 

Dried fish is a staple of Yanbu cuisine, the fish is cut, salted and kept to dry for a period of time, then cooked into any seafood dish, especially in winter.

The region also prides itself in making hearty stews that hit the spot. More specifically, molokhia with fish, a Yanbu AlNakhl specialty, is a comfort dish for locals. 

A typical Yanbuan kitchen is marked by an orchestration of flavors. From the masharmal, a baked or fried fish with citrus fruits served with tahini sauce, to the mafti, a heartwarming aromatic fish stew cooked with tamarind, the smell of the dishes alone will excite one's palate.

Alongside these local plates are rice pairings influenced by the Arab world. Expect to be served some rice with shrimp and madoos (rice with lentil). 

Desserts are also a part of the Yanbu cuisine, and they have bite-size indulgences for those with a sweet tooth. An example of this is the mash'aba, a pretzel-like treat made from very thin dough mixed with rose water and drizzled with syrup and garnished with chopped or grated nuts (such as pistachios) or sesame. Alongside this dessert are biscuits like simsimiyah and lawziyah made with sesame seeds and almonds, respectively.

Last but far from least is harissa, a chickpea flour and butter-based cake drizzled with butter or ghee and garnished with almonds. It is a comforting yet rich dessert that accompanies Yanbuan gatherings, paired with Arabic coffee and tea.

Hijazi flavors
The Delicious Delicacies of Jeddah
An array of seafood dishes
Jeddah is a melting pot of cultures and traditions, all of which have significantly influenced the city’s culinary scene resulting in the rich, diverse, and savory palette of Hejaz. However, many may not know that despite its unique cosmopolitan affluence, the aptly named Bride of The Sea exemplifies the pride of a historic port city, with a treasure trove of freshly caught seafood, such as Najil, Hamoor, Hareed and Sijan, alongside a vast selection of crustaceans, shrimp and shellfish. All of which are a must-try on your next Hejazi culinary adventure.

Fried Najil 
Elegant in its simplicity, this scrumptiously decadent dish is considered seafood royalty. It is well known for its soft and succulent white meat. Cleaned, and prepped with minimal, but essential, local spices before being fried to perfection, the Najil (grouper) is an absolute local favourite, and a dish that ensures you have the best, unparalleled, and most authentic, Jeddawi experience. 

Fried Sijan 
Despite its small size, Sijan is packed with flavor, especially when it’s fried to a crisp. Even though it is found along both the West and East coasts of Saudi Arabia, this delicate dish is an acquired taste, but one that definitely needs to be sampled, even if only to immerse yourself into local foodie debates.

Fried Shrimp and Fried Crab
Two different flavored fish, a wide selection of flavor profiles, and endless preparations; small or jumbo-sized, fried or boiled, steamed or sauteed, char-grilled or barbecued… The choice is yours. There’s no wrong way to cook crustaceans in Jeddah, however, for those who fear a fishy flavor, we recommend going for the frequently fried, or sauced and spiced, for a juicier taste. 

Fish Kofta
The fish cake; an uncommon take on a fish dish, but widely accepted in Jeddah as it resembles the taste of crab cakes, with a more fisher-flavor. Koftas are often prepared using fresh fish filets along with onions, cilantro, mashed potato, and local spices, mixed together, formed into round shapes, before being dipped in the usual egg, flour, and bread crumb trifecta, and then fried till golden.

Mashramel
This unique fish dish is a treasured local secret, prepared with a mixture of tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, before heading to the oven to be baked to perfection, and then served with a sprinkle of pine nuts and parsley leaves. The homey feel of this heartwarming dish will certainly have you coming back for more. 

Matfi Samak
This sour take on samak (fish) is one of the most traditional meals in the region. Served as a side dish on special occasions, Matfi Samak is cooked with tamarind sauce and a special blend of regional spices that are perfectly complemented with Sayyadiah rice for a pleasantly hearty meal. 

Kozi Samak
A dish with flavors that are as commanding as its presence in the most esteemed of Jeddawi occasions, traditional Kozi is made of Hamour fish that is cooked with tomato, yoghurt, garlic, onion and saffron, over a Tawa pan, for a most distinct flavor. The fish is then placed on a bed of rice and pasta, and garnished with nuts, raisins, and boiled eggs. Give Kozi a try for an unforgettable trip to the most historically traditional of Jeddah’s recognizable cuisine.

Capital Cuisine
The Traditional Dishes of the Najd
Najdi cuisine encompasses the traditions and recipes associated with the country and has distinctive attributes of its own. Influenced by the region’s topography and desert climates—Najd dishes are hearty and wholesome, the food is dominated by rich stews, wheat, and rice dishes paired with fragrant spices. 

The heirloom recipes differ from family to family and have been passed down the generations. The traditional cooking in the Najd is known for lengthy preparation, however, this labor of love is certainly worth the wait. 

Jareesh is a humble and hearty porridge dish made with coarsely ground wheat, choice of meat, tomatoes (or without depending on one’s choice), cooked together and topped with a heap of caramelized onions. Mataziz and Marquq are another savory duo: pasta-like dishes featuring chunks of meat teamed with a handful of nutritious vegetables and wheat or rye flour dough discs, cooked in smooth tomato sauce. The only difference between the two is that Marquq discs are larger and soupier.

Another savory dish, Ghorsan features a classic meat gravy filled with vegetables, spices, and dried thin sheets of bread. The sheets of bread are placed on top of the meat and vegetables until it soaks up all the flavorful juices of the nourishing broth. Ghorsan is a classic at the tables of the Qassim region. To feast like a king, Kabsa is a national staple dish with flavorful rice and meat that is served in almost all homes and eateries in the Najd region. For sides, the Cooked Salad, a Najdi salsa cooked with onion, tomato and hot chilli, served along with grills and Kabsa adds an amazing fresh flavor and zing to the dishes.

Talking about traditional sweets of the Najd, Hinaini is a specialty during winters. Made by mixing roasted wheat bread with de-pitted soft dates and melted butter, it’s usually eaten as a dessert—or can be a meal on its own as well.

Kleija is a stuffed biscuit dough shaped like a patterned disk with a special wooden mold. These biscuits hail from the date-rich province of Qassim and are filled with a variety of fillings including a smooth date paste or nut-sugar filling paired perfectly with a hot finjan of gahwa.

Masabeeb, dubbed as the Saudi pancakes, are popular little pancake bites made with whole-wheat batter fried and doused in honey or date syrup. Similarly, Luqaimat are deep-fried pastry balls dunked into hot oil until crisp and golden brown, and then dusted with confectioners' sugar or drizzled with honey. They are most commonly eaten as a snack or a filling dessert. Luqaimat are a favorite among locals and can often be found at street stalls throughout the region.

Winter Comfort: Local Seasonal Dishes to Try

Najdi comfort food
Must try soul-satisfying dishes
In Saudi Arabia, the best local fare is earmarked either for Ramadan or winter—we cover the latter here. With winter in full swing, now is the time to try these grandma approved wintry dishes that provide much-needed soul-satisfying warmth.

Bakeela
One of the most comforting dishes you could wish for, Bakeela is made by kneading dates and mixing it in the powder of a Samah plant that grows in the country's north. The dish is popular in the Al Jouf region, where the temperatures are among the country's lowest.

Saleeg
Popular in the Hijaz, this time-tested wintry favorite is what the locals bank on when the mercury starts to dip. Rice is cooked in chicken broth and milk. The result is a risotto type of creamy rice accompanied by succulent chicken and dollops of butter.

Hinaini
Though easy to make, Hinaini packs a nutritional punch. You need three essential ingredients—dates, brown flour, and ghee. The trio pair so well in this dish that can double as a meal on its own. Top it with a scoop of fresh cream if you'd like.

Desert Truffles
About a week after the first winter rains, truffle hunters head to the deserts in the eastern part of the country in search of the transient desert truffles. They follow trails, looking for signs in their quest like they've learned from their forefathers. There are many types of desert truffles that grow in these deserts with the most prized being the Zubedi. You can make a soup of it or even add it to your Kabsa—it is bound to elevate any dining experience.

Matazeez
The hearty stew is made of bite-sized dough pieces cooked in a pot of meat, vegetables, and spices. The dough soaks up all the delectable flavors of the casserole, and you'll find yourself hard-pressed to stop once you start.

Abu Farwa (Chestnuts)
Harvested in early winter, chestnuts are roasted and then served with honey or ghee—a winter picnic and keshta must-have.

Hijazi Almond Coffee
There's nothing like a piping hot cup of coffee on a cold wintry day. But this isn't just your regular cup of coffee—it’s got coffee in its name but not in the actual drink itself. Nonetheless, coffee lovers may just love this Instagram-friendly drink for its use of milk that’s infused with Middle Eastern spices, blanch almonds and rice flour.

Jareesh
A recipe worthy of being passed down multiple generations, Jareesh is a porridge-like dish that makes a hearty meal, especially in winter. Made using ground wheat, rice, and meat or chicken and topped with plenty of caramelized onions, it ticks all the boxes.
A classic jareesh is essential in any cook's repertoire, it's a perfect finale to a Saudi-style meal to warm you on a chilly evening. 

Aseedah
As you travel around the country you’ll notice that many of the local delicacies vary by region; one of the very few traditional dishes that remains popular across the board is the Aseedah. Crafted primarily from wholewheat, Aseedah is deceptive in its simplicity. Cooks often make an indentation on it that's later filled with ghee or honey.

Oats Soup
Among the smorgasbord of delectable soups that one finds in Saudi Arabia, the chicken oats shorba stands out. A steaming bowl of this comforting soup is sure to be your companion every winter.

Karak Tea
Karak Tea packs a punch of flavor thanks to its generous use of spices. It’s so popular nowadays that you’ll find it in almost every drive through café. This tea is generally credited to the country’s large South Asian expat community.

Hassawi Rice
One of the most expensive rice varieties, Hassawi Rice, grows in the vast oasis of Al Ahsa. The rice is known for its reddish-brown color and for only growing in unusually high temperatures. It's highly nutritious, too, and that's why the locals don't mind shedding the extra buck for it. Grilled or fried fish best compliment a plate of steamed Hassawi rice.

Muhammer
A traditional dish, Muhammer is a combination of sweet rice seasoned with local spices and date molasses. It is often eaten along with local fish that is either grilled or fried. The rice is initially boiled and then steamed for extra flavor.

Shrimp Kabsa (Makboos)

Wadmah Hisawiyah
Prepared with ground dried sardines and citron or lemon and pomegranate and served with green onions, red radishes, and Jarjeer (Arugula).

Fateer
Feteer is a type of local flatbread. Flour, water, and salt are mixed together to form a later sectioned and shaped soft dough and cooked on a flat pan till adequately cooked.

In the Eastern Province, this sugary dish made of pearls of sago is a common item on many Ramadan breakfast tables. Though it is a sweet dish, it has a very refreshing taste to it. 

Balaleet
Balaleet is a traditional dish consisting of vermicelli. It is eaten either with sweet condiments like sugar and cardamom and rose water or savory with sautéed onions potatoes topped with fried onion. 

Afousa

Flavors from a Makkawi Kitchen
A taste of Makkah
A melting pot of flavors
Pilgrims have flocked to Makkah for over a millennium, bringing their different cultures to the heart of Arabia. This transcontinental exchange influenced the cuisine that has developed in Makkah. It is a melting pot of flavors brought by pilgrims and the locals who welcomed them. 

Sobia
Thirst-quenching Sobia is customarily consumed after a long day of fasting in the holy month of Ramadan. It comes in many colors and flavors, all with an essential ingredient that remains unchanged—barley. The barley gives it an earthy flavor that sets it miles apart from other juices.

Hummus Rice
A dish unique to this part of the world consists of lamb meat, dried chickpeas, and rice infused with Middle Eastern spices. If you love mutton biryani, then you'll utterly love this too. It is usually served with tahini and cucumber salad.

Kebab Miro
Kebabs come in many varieties. For meat lovers, the search never stops as they hunt for the perfect unctuous, juicy kebab. Enter a restaurant where Kebab Miro is grilling, and you'll find it inundated in a delightful smell of this juicy kebab as it wafts through the air. Cut in the shape of meatballs; this kebab uses spices aplenty.

Tagatea
Tagatea is easy to come by as several restaurants in the city serve this dish. It's a flavor and texture frenzy of lambs' kidneys, livers, and spleens. You can have it on its own or add it to a baguette type of bread called Samoli to make a sandwich.

Aish Bil Lahm
If pizzas are your thing, you have to try this traditional Saudi version of it. One of its main differences is that Aish bil Lahm uses meat copiously instead of small scattered pieces. It also uses a sauce made of hulled sesame called Tahina that gives it a distinct taste.

Labniya
It's hard walking past a sweet shop displaying slabs of mouth-watering Labniya without heading in for a mouthful. Milky Labniya uses the rose water of Taif's famous 30-petal Damask rose that douses the sweet in a rosy fragrance.

Mamool
These date-based Arabian cookies are a time-tested favorite. On the day of Eid, you'll probably find mamool in every house. A festive treat for a joyous occasion.

Mashbak
Like other dishes that became famous in this part of the world, Mashbak came to the city through pilgrims. Some say that it was initially brought here by the Egyptians. Some say it was the Indians, and many credits it to the Syrians. No matter where it came from, this deep-fried sweet snack is much loved all over Makkah. You'll find it on display arranged in irregular coils. They offer a unique crispy texture once you bite in.

The Traditional Cuisine of Al Baha
A Serving of Generosity and Hospitality
The people of Al Baha are well known for their authentic Arab generosity, which is evident in their feasts. The latter represents the pride of the region, exemplified in the way each dish is prepared and presented.

Al Baha is distinguished by a multiplicity of popular plates, a result of the cultural diversity in the region, from Sarat, Tihama, and the Badia. Despite the emergence of modern food options and international cuisine in its cities, Al Baha’s traditional dishes are still preferred even among the younger generation.

In Al Baha, it’s part of the culture to have family members visit each other without prior notice. This has come to influence the spreads of households, and Al Bahans are always ready to host. As such, they’ve developed dishes that show generosity and hospitality but are simple enough to be prepared quickly. Expect to be welcomed into homes with local renditions of canapes, aside from platters of sweets, fruits, coffee, dates, and mint tea.

Here are some of the main dishes you may come across when you visit Al Baha:

Daghabees
It is considered to be one of the most important and famous southern offerings, especially in the Ghamid and Zahran regions. Daghabees is a filling dish that provides the body with energy, so it is often eaten in the winter. It is made of dough disks that are cooked in meat or chicken broth, and it can be substituted with chicken; vegetables can also be added as desired.

Asidah
A well-known dish in most regions of the Kingdom and the Arab world, it is similar to porridge and has maintained its place as a main dish on the southern table. Asidah is made from corn or wheat flour and served with broth and meat. Milk or water is placed in a saucepan over a fire, and flour is gradually added to it and stirred with a wooden spoon called al-Muswat. This process is called al-Asad, which is where the name Asidah came from. 

Magnah Bread
It is a type of bread that the people of the region are proud of and is distinguishable for its large size that symbolizes generosity. It may take up to five hours to prepare depending on its size. Magnah is prepared by kneading flour with water, then the dough is placed on a hot rock called Masalah (or Almalah) and covered with branches of local plants called Tabag or Shath. It is left on the rock to cook and then served to guests with honey and ghee.

Fatteh
One of the most popular and light dishes in the region, Fatteh is made by cutting the bread into small pieces and mixing it with either milk, or dates or honey and ghee.

Alkhoot 
Hardly any house in the Al Baha region doesn't make Alkhoot because of its health benefits and good taste. Alkhoot is made by boiling garden cress with other herbs such as dill, chard, spinach, parsley, fennel, and other local plants. While bringing the ingredients to tenderness, a dough made with cornflour is added in. The stew-like dish is cooked in low heat for about half an hour.

reshly squeezed
3 Saudi fruit juices that hit the spot
Save to my favorites
One of the most popular beverages in Saudi Arabia these days isn’t brewed, it’s squeezed. Traditionally, Saudis drank more hot beverages, but things are changing. “In contemporary lifestyle, juices are a big element,” says heritage food documenter Majed Al Muhanna.

Juices are popular in Saudi and across the GCC, where the juice market was valued at US$2.5 billion in 2019. Natural fruit juices are on the rise for a few reasons — among them, GCC government healthy eating initiatives that promote juice consumption, and a growing demand for organic and natural halal food options.

Of the GCC countries, Saudi Arabia is the leader in the juice market, which is clear by the sheer availability of the beverages. Sold in grocery stores, served in restaurants and hotels, and popping up at juice specialty shops like Signature and Juice World, juices are easy to come by in the kingdom. “People love apple cider [and] like mango juices, apple juices, and fruit mixtures,” Al Muhanna says, adding that mocktail versions of mojitos and pina coladas are also popular. 

“We do like a strong flavor and a sweet flavor,” Al Muhanna says. “For a Saudi, they’re not drinking alcohol, so to complement the food, the juice or drink needs to be more flavored.”

Get a taste of some of Saudi’s best squeezes with these three juices.

Nonalcoholic Saudi Cooler
Previously called a Saudi Cooler because it’s light, refreshing, and cool on a summer day, Saudi Cooler (also known as Saudi Champagne) is one of the most popular drinks at hotels and fine dining restaurants. A mix of apple juice and sparkling water with thin slices of oranges, lemons, apples, and sprigs of fresh mint, it’s easy to see the appeal. “I love it because it has a hint of mint flavor,” Al Muhanna says. “It’s light. It’s not that sweet.”

Mango Juice 
Mango is a very popular juice among Saudis, which is why you’ll see it both on its own and combined with other fruits. Try a refreshing glass of mango juice straight up or mixed with avocado, guava, milk or strawberry. Prefer a mocktail? Mango juice is also commonly incorporated into juice cocktails, such as mango mojitos, in Saudi.

Lemon Mint Juice
One of the best-known juice combinations in the Middle East is lemon mint, sometimes called limonana. The ingredients include freshly squeezed lemon, mint, sugar and water. Not as sweet as American lemonade but equally if not more popular during the summer, lemon mint can be found at restaurants across Saudi. You’ll also find many adjustments made to this classic, such as lemon mint strawberry juice, and new variations are created every day.

Breaking Ramadan Fast
Juices popular during the month of Ramadan
One crowd pleaser during this time is a cordial that, when mixed with water, becomes juice. “It’s made from blackberries, which are grown in the western mountain region because it’s cold,” says heritage food documenter Majed Al Muhanna. “People used to drink blackberry juice, [and now] people like the condensed one; you mix it with cold water and sugar to your taste. It has a nice connection to the traditional past.” Another popular choice is an apricot juice known as Qamar Al-Din, and sobia, which is made with leftover pieces of bread or raisins and water.
