King Abdullah Economic City
Luxury and leisure in Saudi’s newest city
King Abdullah Economic City, 100 kilometers north of Jeddah along the coast of the Red Sea, is a modern metropolis and booming tourist destination. Though it was conceived of in 2005 to attract international business, leisure is also a big part of KAEC’s appeal. International tournaments are played at the Royal Greens Golf & Country Club, one of the most renowned golf clubs in the Middle East, and a motorsports park is being built as part of the recently developed Lagoona leisure area. The expansive waterfront — which can be enjoyed year-round, as the desert climate in KAEC averages 28 degrees C — is another major draw, from the bike-friendly Beach Walk to soft-sand Yam Beach, which offers a range of watersports.
