Saudi’s Eastern Province: Exploring Dammam

All About Dammam
Boasting endless views of the tranquil Arabian Gulf, Dammam is a modern metropolis that thrives on its coastal location. Although it is known for its lush green parks, airy waterfronts and sandy beaches, it is highly enjoyable in the winter, too, with daytime temperatures averaging in the low 20s Celsius during the day and around 10 degrees at night. The region also has a growing reputation as an arts, sports and entertainment destination. It is home to the kingdom’s first street-art exhibition, in Al Khobar’s Bayoonya district, and offers a range of cultural hubs and museums as well. Dip into science and innovation at SCITECH, or get your fill of pop culture at the quirky Taybeen and Alfelwah and Aljowharah museums. As evening falls, wander the walkways of Dammam's Share Al Hob souq, where you may encounter traders, performers and street musicians.

When in Dammam, go and explore:

Half Moon Bay
A short drive south from Dammam, Half Moon Bay was a stop for many of the Arab traders from the Arabian Gulf area. It has become a top draw for recreation thanks to its family-friendly setup: The entrances to the cove are very shallow and tranquil, and the average water depth reaches about 7 meters, so it’s an ideal location to learn how to scuba dive, or just dip your toes on a warm winter day.


Saudi Arabia’s cultural hub
The iconic monolithic design of the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture, known as Ithra, has become a symbol of Saudi’s cultural renaissance. The sprawling building houses a theater, library, cinema, galleries and museum, alongside a wealth of interactive activities for children. The Ithra Journey Tour, a 30-minute guided walk, offers an ideal overview of the complex.


Al Khobar waterfront
Dancing fountains and landscaped gardens make this seafront stretch a family favorite, where kids can play in the park as adults take Instagram-worthy snaps of the historic water tower and remarkable King Fahd Causeway. For a bite among the sights, discover a range of dining options on the new Ajdan Walk south of the new corniche, or immerse yourself in Al Khobar’s café culture at one of its dozens of waterfront coffee shops. Consider catching the sunset on a private boat trip.

Exploring the Al Ahsa Oasis
A city in the Eastern Province region
Adventure at every turn
There’s much more to Saudi Arabia than vast ochre deserts. With more than 2.5 million date palm trees blanketing a verdant expanse just inland from Saudi Arabia’s Gulf coast, Al Ahsa is the archetype of a lush desert oasis. And the UNESCO World Heritage-recognized region recently added a new feather to its cap: in October, Guinness World Records declared Al Ahsa the largest self-contained oasis in the world. What that means for travelers is that there’s plenty to choose from. From hot and cold springs to historic mosques to sweeping panoramic vistas, you’ll find a lot to explore in this 6,000-year-old oasis, which has long been a gateway to the Arabian Peninsula for travelers from the East. Don’t miss a chance to sample a khalasah date before you leave —locals proudly proclaim it’s one of the world’s best. But while the date farms are an obvious stop on your Al Ahsa itinerary, here are some other sites you can’t miss.

************************

Al Ahsa: Activities for the Whole Family
Home to one of the biggest oases in the world, Al Ahsa is adequately named; in classical Arabic ‘Ahsa’ means “the sound of water flowing underground”. Boasting tall beautiful date palms and a great location near other cities in the Eastern Province, it’s a great place to visit especially in the cooler months!


Al Ahsa Oasis
A picturesque desert oasis, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors from around the world travel here to enjoy the lush greenery, lively markets and poignant historical sites.


Souq Al Qaisariya
Renowned for its elevated roof and corridors; it holds numerous towers, palaces, mosques and over 422 shops perfect for exploring with the family. And don’t forget to grab a souvenir!


King Abdullah Environmental Park
Amazing place to spend the day, it hosts many events year-round. The water fountain light shows as well as the playgrounds, football stadium, mazes and theater are sure to keep the family occupied all day.


Al Ahsa National Museum
The archaeology and heritage museum located in Hofuf holds a variety of artifacts ranging from the Stone Age to the Babylonian and Assyrian eras.


Al Qarah Mountain
One of the main natural sites in Al Ahsa, perfect for a hiking or camping trip. Join a tour to explore the magnificent caves in the mountain and get to know its history!


The Yellow Lake
Accessible by a four-wheel drive, it is a unique desert destination to enjoy off-roading, photograph the golden sand dunes or bird-watch.


Uqair Beach
A mesmerizing spot to experience a variety of sea activities such as jet skiing, surfing, sailing and fishing. On the shore, dune-cruising and car races are occasionally held, and you can also get a camel or horse ride.


*****************************

An Eastern Wonder Trip for Wander Moms
For moms who love adventure and culture, with a side of metropolitanism, the Al Ahsa Oasis in the Eastern Province is the perfect weekend destination for you and your friends to surround yourselves by nature in an oasis that has something for everyone. 

Al Ahsa
Start your journey by heading to Hofuf which is the capital of Al Ahsa. Enjoy the scenic drive, with grand panoramic views of vast greenery and towering palm trees which is a  part of  the largest palm tree oasis in the world surrounded by fresh water springs.
Pack a picnic basket and visit the beautiful King Abdullah Environmental Park, South of Hofuf. It is a grand park filled with greenery, dancing water fountains, and much more, making it a great spot to lay down a blanket and enjoy a calm and quiet picnic. 

 

Souq Al Qaisariya
Make sure to stop at Souq Al Qaisariya, which is one of the oldest traditional markets in the Eastern Province. It is the best place to browse traditional artifacts and souvenirs while enjoying the old-world atmosphere of the bustling market. You’ll find antique items such as brass teapots, wool carpets, vintage telephones, and many more eccentrically ornate items.

Al Qara Mountain Caves
Head to the beautiful Al Qara Mountain Caves, only a 25-minute drive from Hofuf. These caves require a small entrance fee for above 12 SAR, which include entry into the caves as well as the museum. Although the caves only allow for a short walk through, the experience is too unique to pass up! End your day by stopping at the InterContinental Hotel, where you can enjoy a seafood buffet, whilst basking in the hotel’s grand interior.
 
*****************************

Al Ahsa: Explore Saudi’s Largest Oasis
If you are looking for an escape from the city life to a more historical and enlightening location, head to Al Ahsa in the country's Eastern Province, a UNESCO world heritage site. The region is recognized for its stunning and vivid green palm trees as well as its tranquil atmosphere, profound stillness and peaceful ambience. With 30 million palm trees, you are bound to feel one with nature in the largest date farm worldwide, which produces a few of the Saudi’s sweetest Khalas dates, known for their sticky texture.

Al Qara
One of the most iconic structures in Al Ahsa is the beautifully majestic Al Qara mountains, known for stunning lime caves found amidst it, which create the perfect backdrop for a fun-filled family. Unlike many caves in the country, these were formed by subaerial weathering processes that formed a highly distinctive shape to its structure. It's a natural marvel that one must visit on their trip to the province. 

Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory
Nestled within these caves on the Western elevation is the fantastic Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory that showcases how the making of pottery has been passed down from generation to generation, highlighting the region's rich customs and traditions. 

Ibrahim Palace
Al Ahsa is also historically rich, known to be the abode of the Saudi’s founding monarch, King Abdulaziz. You can step back in time by visiting his room, a part of the Al Mulla Home, housing all of the King's belongings, including key pieces from his wardrobe. Another cultural site you must visit is the beautiful Ibrahim Palace in Al Ahsa’s center, constructed under the Ottoman Empire in 1521.
Pick up some souvenirs in the Al Ahsa market, which is a local souq packed with local treats, from oud to abayas, and other trinkets you will treasure forever.

*****************************

Crafted by hand
Visit Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory
Nestled snugly within the caves of Al Qarah Mountain’s western face, Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory offers an enchanting bonus excursion for any visitors to Al Ahsa’s most famous geological landmark. Visitors will notice a striking display at the entrance, as rows of upturned pots spilling various shades of clay hint at the importance of pottery in the Islamic world. 

Described in the Holy Quran as the substance from which humans were created, the ancient craft of molding clay remains deeply symbolic of the story of humankind. The act of mixing clay with creativity is believed to date back over 15,000 years, and the traditional methods of pottery on show here at Dougha remain closely tied to those used throughout millennia. 

A family business
Walk through the factory’s turreted entrance and fortress-like doors, and the effect is to travel back in time. It’s here where, 150 years ago, a man named Dougha Al Gabash set up shop in one of Al Qarah many cavernous hideouts. The temperate surroundings not only kept him cool but also kept his mountain-sourced clay moist. This was the perfect place for the master potter to begin a craft that he would pass down to his sons, who in turn spread the tradition to their own children.

It is these grandsons who are now in charge at Dougha. The factory may have changed since their grandfather’s day, having expanded to include tourist-friendly lounge areas, restroom facilities and heritage displays. But the finished ceramics remain an in-house skill specific to this corner of Al Ahsa.

The open-air factory is free to enter, and the atmosphere is relaxed. Visitors are encouraged to roam through the palm-lined walkways and take in the sights. And while the ceramics remain the chief reason to visit, there are other items on display that come with a story. There’s the recreated well from where the potters would collect fresh water from Al Ahsa’s plentiful springs. The two-wheeled cart was used for transport before a new irrigation system and modern roads were built in 1967. Then there is the range of vibrant accessories made from date leaves, including bags, hats and also home décor products. 

The pottery-making process
Unlike in the days of its founder — who is honored with photographs and portrait paintings on the wall — visitors to the factory are now frequent. The potters at Dougha are warm and welcoming, and only too happy to demonstrate their talents and provide living proof of the longevity of handmade craftwork.

They begin by throwing a roll of clay onto a foot-powered wheel, built into the rock floor to provide stability. It takes just minutes for their steady arms and fingers to transform malleable clumps of mud into a shape recognized in every home on the planet. Once at its optimal height and uniform width, the jar (or pot, vase, or bowl) is ready to be left under Al Ahsa’s sun. After drying out, the extreme heat of the nearby kiln, fired with dried palm fronds, bakes the clay to its final composition. Traditionally unpainted, there are nevertheless more colorful options to suit personal preferences.

Watching the dexterity, patience and calmness on show, it’s hard not to be entranced by the meditative nature of the process. Here at one of the oldest pottery centers in Saudi Arabia, you’ll find an antidote to the fast and frenetic modern-day methods of mass-production.

The ceramic results of their skilled endeavors are vast, varied and vivid. Stacked on shelves and hanging from the ceilings, you’ll find everything from huge underground cooking pots known as mandi, traditional water coolers (zeer) and mabkhara incense burners. Vessels range in size, with hundreds of suitcase-friendly smaller pots and vases on offer for as little as SAR10 (about US$2.67).

 
Take a turn
Should you wish to try your hand at pottery making, and truly appreciate the finely honed skills involved, then you’re welcome to take a seat at the wheel. Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory opens between 8am and 7pm and individual visitors can request a display from the potters on arrival, though large groups should arrange tours in advance.

*****************************
When in the Al Ahsa Oasis, Go Explore

Al Qarah
Al Qarah stands about 75 meters (or about 250 feet) tall — and the view from the top of the 30,000-acre oasis below is not to be missed. The craggy limestone peaks are well worth scaling, too. Explore the network of caves that carve out snaking pathways flanked by soaring tawny walls, and pay a visit to the Land of Civilizations museum to learn about the area’s millennia-old history.


Jawatha Mosque
Built by the region’s Bani Abd Al Qays tribe in the seventh century, Jawatha Mosque is believed to have been the first mosque in eastern Arabia. It’s also where the second Friday congregation prayer was held. Much of the original building has been destroyed over the centuries, but the mosque was recently restored. Now Friday prayers are regularly recited there again.


Souq Al Qaisariya
Its origins may be unclear — travelers through Al Ahsa have alluded to it in their journals as far back as 1822, though many locals claim it’s been thriving for centuries longer than that — but what is clear is that Souq Al Qaisariya is one of the liveliest, most historical markets in the kingdom. With a maze of more than 7,000 square meters of shops to explore, visitors can bargain for everything from handmade leather sandals to abayas to vials of rosewater, vintage gramophones and antique daggers.


Yellow Lake
On the outskirts of Al Ahsa, this striking lake is hemmed in on all sides by lofty sand dunes and fringed by a thick ring of ferns. Visitors are in for quite an adventure: There are no roads, so you have to get to the banks of the lake by dune-bashing your way over in a four-wheel drive. Once you’re there, have a picnic, go bird-watching (keep an eye out for moustached warblers, Kentish plovers and greater spotted eagles in the winter), or kayak on the lake’s placid waters.


Where to stay in Al hasa?
The InterContinental Al Ahsa is an opulent stay in the heart of Al Ahsa, with close access to all the major landmarks and sweeping oasis views from many of the rooms. Choose from Al Koot Heritage Hotel for old-world charm, or opt for modern style at the Best Western Premier Al Ahsa Grand Hotel.

Science and play collide at SCITECH
 

Forget tedious textbook-based science lessons, Al Khobar's Science and Technology Centre (SCITECH) is home to exhibits so interactive and immersive that they mesmerize children and adults alike. You want to take a tour through the human body, or get up close with Arabian sea creatures? SCITECH can make that happen.

Soaring above the city's corniche, SCITECH combines imaginative displays, interactive experiences and visual galleries, all aimed at getting kids – and people of all ages – excited about science and technology. The complex is Saudi Arabia’s biggest public science gallery, with more than 350 exhibits. These are separated into six main halls, exploring topics such as electricity, sound waves, robots, and the solar system, and the centre also houses a 190-seat IMAX theatre. Look out for these highlights during your trip.

Out of this world 
Take a voyage to the stars in the Earth and Space hall, where kids can experience what it feels like to jet off into space. Whizz through the solar system, learn about the Earth’s place in the galaxy, and get your hands on a replica of the Hubble Space Telescope. Don’t miss the observatory in the north of the complex either: the telescope in this interstellar attraction is spectacular.

Explore the human body
Take a walk through the Living World hall and discover the mysteries of the human body, brought to life through huge models. Find answers to questions such as ‘How does the brain work?’ and pick up tips on staying healthy. Bonus exhibitions about the lifecycles of native animals and plants are also great for teaching kids about the local environment.

Under the sea 
The marvels of underwater life are on show in SCITECH’s sprawling aquariums, with dozens of species of marine life for you to observe.

Enriching activities for the whole family
6 places to visit in the Eastern Province
Save to my favorites
Don’t be fooled by the laid-back air of Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. This region of Saudi Arabia might not have cities with the fast-paced buzz of Jeddah or the urban flair of Riyadh, but this corner of the kingdom has its own compelling story to tell: It’s where the country’s wells of black gold were first discovered, and where the world’s largest oil company was born. It’s also where a small fishing village grew into one of the Middle East’s largest ports, and where Arabia’s biggest and most impressive cultural center was forged.

It’s a region rich in diversity, heritage, and quiet drive that offers something for visitors of all ages. Here are some of the Eastern Province’s top cultural draws:


1. King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture (Ithra) in Dhahran
Rising 90 meters from the desert, Ithra’s sculpted form dominates both the Dhahran skyline and the region’s cultural scene. Built close to the site where oil was first tapped in 1983, Ithra (the Arabic word for “enrichment”) is a world-class cultural center. The future meets the past in the state-of-the-art building, which spans more than 80,000 square meters and includes a vast library, theater, cinema, ideas lab, and knowledge tower, along with a range of curated galleries and installations designed to inspire, engage, and delight. Little ones will particularly love the Children’s Museum. One visitor to the museum said, “The kids particularly enjoyed playing in a sea of Jenga blocks, the infinity mirror room, the illusion and perspective room, colouring corner, and indoor cave. When it was time to leave, it wasn't easy convincing our toddler to let go of all the flashy and attention-grabbing displays!”
Look up the center’s packed program of events, workshops, talks, and performances to see what’s scheduled. Entrance to Ithra is free, but events and the cinema require tickets.

2. The Energy Exhibit in Dhahran
Just a stone’s throw from Ithra is the Energy Exhibit, a hands-on, immersive voyage into the world of petroleum, its science, energy, and technology. The focal point of this kaleidoscopic space is a 12-player interactive game that brings energy production to life through touch-screen gaming. Don’t miss the cutting-edge exhibits, especially those on alternative energy sources.

3. Alfelwah and Aljowharah Museum in Al Nuzha
An avid collector of cultural and traditional artefacts, millionaire philanthropist Abdulwahab Al Ghunaim took his hobby to a new level when he opened the Alfelwah and Aljowharah Museum in 2018. Today, a collection that began as a handful of local treasures is a valuable exhibition of more than 500,000 objects packed into a palatial villa in Dammam.
The eclectic mix of items includes a 500-year-old copy of the Quran, vintage cars, antique gramophones, and some of the private possessions of Saudi Arabia’s first monarch, King Abdulaziz. Visitors can also see a traditional Saudi bedroom and meeting hall setup. There’s something in the quirky assortment of curiosities to pique the interest of every visitor.

4. The Alfan Sharqy Urban Art Exhibit in Bayoniya, Al Khobar
The historic neighbourhood of Bayoniya got a makeover in 2018, courtesy of a coterie of young Saudi artists who turned its streets into a giant canvas, complete with an explosion of graffiti. The Alfan Sharqy (Art is Eastern) graffiti exhibit was organized by Dawi Gallery, under the sponsorship of Princess Abeer bint Faisal Al Saud, and saw six of the area’s traditional houses transformed by a rainbow of murals, chromatic calligraphy, and abstract designs. The walls here are a reminder that exciting and transformative art can appear in the most unexpected of places.

5. Taybeen Museum in Al Khobar
Taybeen Museum is a passion project, powered by nostalgia. The 300-square-meter museum in Al Khobar was born of Majid Al Ghamdi’s urge to preserve the vintage finds of his youth, a pastime that grew into a collection of retro toys, board and video games, posters, televisions, cameras, and branded food and drink containers 10,000 pieces strong. With a cabinet charting the evolution of Coke bottles from the 1970s on, plush Sesame Street character toys and vintage Barbies, there is no better place to relive your childhood.

6. Heritage Village in Dammam
Part museum, part restaurant, Dammam’s turret-topped Heritage Village gives visitors a glimpse into a simpler life. The five-story building houses a museum, where troves of jewellery, manuscripts, fabrics, and other artefacts are on display, and a small craft-filled market where Arabic perfumes, incense, woven palm-frond baskets, and wall hangings are sold. But the biggest draw here for many is the restaurant. Curl up on traditional floor cushions and sample delicious local fare, including delectable mezze spreads and platters of grilled meats and rice, for an experience that comes close to eating in a Saudi home.

Retail in Dammam
Shop the Eastern Province

Shopping in Saudi’s Eastern Province may revolve primarily around Dammam and Al Khobar, the oil-rich cities on the coast, but there are also gems to be found inland in the historic oasis of Al Ahsa.
Shopping in Saudi’s Eastern Province
The most atmospheric shopping experience in Dammam is the Share Al Hob market, in a series of narrow streets and fountain-filled plazas – so named for the gold and jewelry shops that line its outer streets. The market comes alive at night, when the air is filled with the scents of spice and perfume, and concessions sell everything from traditional carpets to ceramics, art and ceremonial swords. There are live sketch artists and singers, and locals come to eat falafel and steaming luqaimat, a type of sweet fried dumpling doused in date syrup and sesame seeds. The Dammam Souq, also known as the women’s market, is another rich local experience, a 17,500sqm collection of jewelry, handicraft and clothing stores, as well as traditional stalls mostly overseen by women.

Dammam and Al Khobar, its cosmopolitan coastal neighbor, are well catered to when it comes to modern shopping centers. The Al Othaim mall, designed like a ship and filled with high palm trees, is home to global brands like H&M, Mango and Next, as well as a dedicated children’s amusement park and extensive food court. The circular, glassy Marina Mall has views across the Dammam Corniche to the sea from the dining area. In Al Khobar, the Rashid Mall is built around a striking central water feature, and is home to cool global fashion brands from Adidas to Dutch fashion label Scotch & Soda.

Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory
There are interesting shopping experiences to be had in the desert inland, too, especially in the World Heritage-listed oasis of Al Ahsa. The Dougha Handmade Pottery Factory isn’t just for learning about the 15,000-year-old craft of moulding clay, described in the Quran as the substance from which humans were created. You can also watch potters molding lumps of clay the traditional way, and buy everything from mandi cooking pots to mabkhara incense burners.

Souq Al Qaisariya
Also in Al Ahsa, the Souq Al Qaisariya is a centuries-old market in a 7,000sqm area of clay-brick buildings and narrow alleys that feels like a fortress palace. Sellers across more than 400 wooden-shuttered stalls offer everything from bright tea pots and chests to prayer beads, abayas, yashmak veils, incense and knives newly forged on a street of blacksmiths.

Popular food includes vacuum packs of dried fish and shrimp, often eaten with spicy dip, and one of the regional favorite dishes available at the Al Said cafe at the northern end of the market. Although widely believed to have been built in 1822, some historians argue the souq is actually 600 years old. Either way, it is a history you can feel, and buy a piece of to take home.
